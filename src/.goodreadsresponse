  <description>The spectacular finale to the New York Times bestselling trilogy that began with Mr. Mercedes (winner of the Edgar Award) and Finders Keepers—In End of Watch, the diabolical “Mercedes Killer” drives his enemies to suicide, and if Bill Hodges and Holly Gibney don’t figure out a way to stop him, they’ll be victims themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, something has awakened. Something evil. Brady Hartsfield, perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, where eight people were killed and many more were badly injured, has been in the clinic for five years, in a vegetative state. According to his doctors, anything approaching a complete recovery is unlikely. But behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake, and in possession of deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable havoc without ever leaving his hospital room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, now runs an investigation agency with his partner, Holly Gibney—the woman who delivered the blow to Hartsfield’s head that put him on the brain injury ward. When Bill and Holly are called to a suicide scene with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet, one that will put their lives at risk, as well as those of Bill’s heroic young friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back, and planning revenge not just on Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In End of Watch, Stephen King brings the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion, combining the detective fiction of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers with the heart-pounding, supernatural suspense that has been his bestselling trademark. The result is an unnerving look at human vulnerability and chilling suspense. No one does it better than King.</description>

  <description>The winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, as well as five other awards, &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; is the breakthrough novel of the year. With the pace and suspense of a thriller and prose that has been compared to Graham Greene and Saul Bellow, &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; is a sweeping epic of love and betrayal. The narrator, a communist double agent, is a “man of two minds,” a half-French, half-Vietnamese army captain who arranges to come to America after the Fall of Saigon, and while building a new life with other Vietnamese refugees in Los Angeles is secretly reporting back to his communist superiors in Vietnam. &lt;i&gt;The Sympathizer&lt;/i&gt; is a blistering exploration of identity and America, a gripping espionage novel, and a powerful story of love and friendship.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Why Do Kids These Days Expect Everything to be Given to Them?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's kids don't know how to read a map. They can Google the answer to any question at lightning speed. If a teen forgets his homework, a quick call to mom or dad has it hand-delivered in minutes. Fueled by the rapid pace of technology, the Instant Gratification Generation not only expects immediate solutions to problems—they're more dependent than ever on adults. Today's kids are being denied opportunities to make mistakes, and more importantly, to learn from them. They are being taught not to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Teaching Kids to Think&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Darlene Sweetland and Dr. Ron Stolberg offer insight into the social, emotional, and neurological challenges unique to this generation. They identify the five parent traps that cause adults to unknowingly increase their children's need for instant gratification, and offer practical tips and easy-to-implement solutions to address topics relevant to children of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A must-read for parents and educators, &lt;em&gt;Teaching Kids to Think&lt;/em&gt; will help you understand where this sense of entitlement comes from—and how to turn it around in order to raise children who are confident, independent, and thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive history of America’s greatest incubator of innovation, the birthplace of some of the 20th century’s most influential technologies, including the integrated circuit, the communications satellite and the cell phone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs—officially, the research and development wing of AT&amp;amp;T—was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, it’s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn’t been touched by Bell Labs. &lt;br /&gt;Why did so many transformative ideas come from Bell Labs?  In &lt;i&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/i&gt;, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century’s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men—Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker—who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Their job was to research and develop the future of communications.  Small-town boys, childhood hobbyists, oddballs: they give the lie to the idea that Bell Labs was a grim cathedral of top-down command and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gertner brings to life the powerful alchemy of the forces at work behind Bell Labs inventions, teasing out the intersections between science, business, and society. He distills the lessons that abide: how to recruit and nurture young talent; how to organize and lead fractious employees; how to find solutions to the most stubbornly vexing problems; how to transform a scientific discovery into a marketable product, then make it even better, cheaper, or both. Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the origins of modern communications and the beginnings of the information age—a deeply human story of extraordinary men who were given extraordinary means—time, space, funds, and access to one another—and edged the world into a new dimension.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Liar’s Poker&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; in an irreverent exposé of life inside the tech bubble, from industry provocateur Antonio García Martínez, a former Twitter advisor, Facebook product manager and startup founder/CEO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is, Silicon Valley capitalism is very simple:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investors are people with more money than time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Employees are people with more time than money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurs are the seductive go-between.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marketing is like sex: only losers pay for it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a chimpanzee rampaging through a datacenter powering everything from Google to Facebook. Infrastructure engineers use a software version of this “chaos monkey” to test online services’ robustness—their ability to survive random failure and correct mistakes before they actually occur. Tech entrepreneurs are society’s chaos monkeys, disruptors testing and transforming every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and lodging (AirBnB) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder). One of Silicon Valley’s most audacious chaos monkeys is Antonio García Martínez.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After stints on Wall Street and as CEO of his own startup, García Martínez joined Facebook’s nascent advertising team, turning its users’ data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark “Zuck” Zuckerberg. Forced out in the wake of an internal product war over the future of the company’s monetization strategy, García Martínez eventually landed at rival Twitter. He also fathered two children with a woman he barely knew, committed lewd acts and brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg's desk), lived on a sailboat, raced sport cars on the 101, and enthusiastically pursued the life of an overpaid Silicon Valley wastrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this gleeful contrarian unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing and reveals how it is invading our lives and shaping our future. Weighing in on everything from startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetization and digital “privacy,” García Martínez shares his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a humorous, subversive tour of the fascinatingly insular tech industry. &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; lays bare the hijinks, trade secrets, and power plays of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists, accidental tourists, and money cowboys who are revolutionizing our world. The question is, will we survive?</description>

  <description>What would happen if the world were ending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five thousand years later, their progeny—seven distinct races now three billion strong—embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision, Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable. As he did in Anathem, Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle, and Reamde, Stephenson explores some of our biggest ideas and perplexing challenges in a breathtaking saga that is daring, engrossing, and altogether brilliant.</description>

  <description>I am writing this book because I had a hard time learning Haskell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't have to be that way. I've spent the last couple years actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way, I started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques in Haskell that eventually turned into my guide for learning haskell. That experience led me to work on this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to programming entirely, Haskell is a great first language. You may have noticed the trend of "Functional Programming in [Imperative Language]" books and tutorials and learning Haskell gets right to the heart of what functional programming is. Languages such as Java are gradually adopting functional concepts, but most such languages were not designed to be functional languages, after all. We would not encourage you to learn Haskell as an only language, but because Haskell is a pure functional language, it is a fertile environment for mastering functional programming techniques. That way of thinking and problem solving is useful, no matter what other languages you might know or learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite. I'm now able to tackle problems that I couldn't have tackled when I was primarily a Clojure, Common Lisp, or Python user. Haskell is difficult to teach effectively.</description>

  <description>Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are you often busy but not productive?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the &lt;i&gt;Way of the Essentialist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting &lt;i&gt;only the right things&lt;/i&gt; done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a &lt;i&gt;systematic discipline&lt;/i&gt; for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything. A must-read for any leader, manager, or individual who wants to learn who to do less, but better, in every area of their lives, Essentialism  is a movement whose time has come.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;The rousing story of the last gasp of human agency and how today’s best and brightest minds are endeavoring to put an end to it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It used to be that to diagnose an illness, interpret legal documents, analyze foreign policy, or write a newspaper article you needed a human being with specific skills—and maybe an advanced degree or two. These days, high-level tasks are increasingly being handled by algorithms that can do precise work not only with speed but also with nuance. These “bots” started with human programming and logic, but now their reach extends beyond what their creators ever expected. In this fascinating, frightening book, Christopher Steiner tells the story of how algorithms took over—and shows why the “bot revolution” is about to spill into every aspect of our lives, often silently, without our knowledge. The May 2010 “Flash Crash” exposed Wall Street’s reliance on trading bots to the tune of a 998-point market drop and $1 trillion in vanished market value. But that was just the beginning. In &lt;i&gt;Automate This&lt;/i&gt;, we meet bots that are driving cars, penning haiku, and writing music mistaken for Bach’s. They listen in on our customer service calls and figure out what Iran would do in the event of a nuclear standoff. There are algorithms that can pick out the most cohesive crew of astronauts for a space mission or identify the next Jeremy Lin. Some can even ingest statistics from baseball games and spit out pitch-perfect sports journalism indistinguishable from that produced by humans. The interaction of man and machine can make our lives easier. But what will the world look like when algorithms control our hospitals, our roads, our culture, and our national security? What hap­pens to businesses when we automate judgment and eliminate human instinct? And what role will be left for doctors, lawyers, writers, truck drivers, and many others?  Who knows—maybe there’s a bot learning to do your job this minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The computer and the internet are among the most important innovations of our era, but few people know who created them. They were not conjured up in a garret or garage by solo inventors suitable to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell, and Morse. Instead, most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively. There were a lot of fascinating people involved, some ingenious and a few even geniuses. This is the story of these pioneers, hackers, inventors, and entrepreneurs—who they were, how their minds worked, and what made them so creative. It’s also a narrative of how they collaborated and why their ability to work as teams made them even more creative.”</description>

      <![CDATA[This book describes "how a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution." It is a fascinating read about the stories behind many inventions. <br /><br />Several lessons can be learned from the book about how innovations come from ideas and what kind of thoughts and personalities are put into them. <br /><br />- Innovation is the result of collaboration. Ideas are built upon ideas. Innovation hardly comes from a sole genius.<br /><br />- The most productive team of innovators combines wide array of specialities: people with visionaries and people with strict management (Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore need to work with Andy Groove - Intel), people with excellent engineering skills (Steve Wozniak) and people with good product vision (Steve Jobs), theorists and experimentalist (Bell Labs), etc. <br /><br />- Although artificial intelligence is hot, there are still many years until a machine thinking on its own becomes a reality. Maybe a better alternative is augmented intelligence, where human and machine work together, each contributes its own strength (creativity, decision making from human and unlimited computing from machine) to produce much better innovation. This is the power of human-machine symbiosis. An example here is IBM Thomas Watson service. <br /><br />- As Steve Jobs said, "technology alone is not enough---that it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing."<br /><br />There is one thing I noted: the story line of the book is quite smooth to support several points that the author made in the book. The book tries to describe a lot of people and ideas in a limited number of pages, thus many technical details must have been overseen. However, this is still a good biography of the Digital Age; readers can learn about how technology are progressing and affecting their lives and their future. ]]>

  <description>Despite your graduate education, brainpower, and technical prowess, your career in scientific research is far from assured. Permanent positions are scarce, science survival is rarely part of formal graduate training, and a good mentor is hard to find. This exceptional volume explains what stands between you and fulfilling long-term research career. Bringing the key survival skills into focus, &lt;i&gt;A Ph.D. Is Not Enough!&lt;/i&gt; proposes a rational approach to establishing yourself as a scientist. It offers sound advice of selecting a thesis or postdoctoral adviser, choosing among research jobs in academia, government laboratories, and industry, preparing for an employment interview, and defining a research program. This book will help you make your oral presentations effective, your journal articles compelling, and your grant proposals successful. &lt;i&gt;A Ph.D. Is Not Enough&lt;/i&gt; should be required reading for anyone on the threshold of a career in science.</description>

  <description>This is a world divided by blood - red or silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reds are commoners, ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like superpowers. And to Mare Barrow, a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing will ever change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace. Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most, Mare discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that threatens to destroy the balance of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver prince. Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help the Red Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance - Reds against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart...</description>

  <description>Put away your moral compass. Learn to say "I don't know." Think like a child.Take a master class in incentives. Appreciate the upside of quitting. . . . And more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think Like a Freak is Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner's most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and teach us all to think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally to think, that is, like a Freak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Levitt and Dubner offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems, whether your interest lies in minor lifehacks or major global reforms. As always, no topic is off-limits. They range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, you'll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying they're from Nigeria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing and so much fun to read."</description>

  <description>Everyone is born curious. But only some retain the habits of exploring, learning and discovering as they grow older. Which side of the ’curiosity divide’ are you on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Curious Ian Leslie makes a passionate case for the cultivation of our desire to know. Curious people tend to be smarter, more creative and more successful. But at the very moment when the rewards of curiosity have never been higher, it is misunderstood and undervalued, and increasingly practised only by a cognitive elite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filled with inspiring stories, case studies and practical advice, Curious will change the way you think about your own mental life, and that of those around you.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller — With a new Afterword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Michael Lewis's game-changing bestseller, a small group of Wall Street iconoclasts realize that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders. They band together—some of them walking away from seven-figure salaries—to investigate, expose, and reform the insidious new ways that Wall Street generates profits. If you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you.</description>

      <![CDATA[ This is a story about how high frequency trade. It describes how HFT makes money of the US stock market by taking advantage of speed.<br /><br /> The protagonists are a group of people who step away from very high pay from major banks to restore fairness to the stock market.<br /><br /> There are couple of things I felt about the book when I was reading the book. One is Lewis doesn't give enough views from the other side (high frequency traders). The traders appear to be anonymous throughout the story. Second, the story becomes less interesting after the first half; it seems repetitive to me.<br /><br /> It turns out there are not good things that people talk about this book too. You can see them in some Goodreads users' reviews.<br /><br /><br />]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;A mission to Mars.&lt;br /&gt;A freak accident.&lt;br /&gt;One man's struggle to survive.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate the planet while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded on Mars' surface, completely alone, with no way to signal Earth that he’s alive. And even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone years before a rescue could arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chances are, though, Mark won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment or plain-old "human error" are much more likely to kill him first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mark's not ready to quit. Armed with nothing but his ingenuity and his engineering skills—and a gallows sense of humor that proves to be his greatest source of strength–he embarks on a dogged quest to stay alive, using his botany expertise to grow food and even hatching a mad plan to contact NASA back on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he overcomes one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next, Mark begins to let himself believe he might make it off the planet alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mars has plenty of surprises in store for him yet.</description>

  <description>A decade ago, fourteen-year-old Suzanne Lombard, the daughter of Benjamin Lombard—then a senator, now a powerful vice president running for the presidency—disappeared in the most sensational missing-person case in the nation’s history. Still unsolved, the mystery remains a national obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legendary hacker and marine Gibson Vaughn, the case is personal—Suzanne Lombard had been like a sister to him. On the tenth anniversary of her disappearance, the former head of Benjamin Lombard’s security asks for Gibson’s help in a covert investigation of the case, with new evidence in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by tragic memories, he jumps at the chance to uncover what happened all those years ago. Using his military and technical prowess, he soon discovers multiple conspiracies surrounding the Lombard family—and he encounters powerful, ruthless political players who will do anything to silence him and his team. With new information surfacing that could threaten Lombard’s bid for the presidency, Gibson must stay one step ahead as he navigates a dangerous web to get to the truth.</description>

  <description>The magnificent, unrivaled history of codes and ciphers—how they're made, how they're broken, and the many and fascinating roles they've played since the dawn of civilization in war, business, diplomacy, and espionage—updated with a new chapter on computer cryptography and the Ultra secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man has created codes to keep secrets and has broken codes to learn those secrets since the time of the Pharaohs. For 4,000 years, fierce battles have been waged between codemakers and codebreakers, and the story of these battles is civilization's secret history, the hidden account of how wars were won and lost, diplomatic intrigues foiled, business secrets stolen, governments ruined, computers hacked. From the XYZ Affair to the Dreyfus Affair, from the Gallic War to the Persian Gulf, from Druidic runes and the kaballah to outer space, from the Zimmermann telegram to Enigma to the Manhattan Project, codebreaking has shaped the course of human events to an extent beyond any easy reckoning. Once a government monopoly, cryptology today touches everybody. It secures the Internet, keeps e-mail private, maintains the integrity of cash machine transactions, and scrambles TV signals on unpaid-for channels. David Kahn's &lt;i&gt;The Codebreakers&lt;/i&gt; takes the measure of what codes and codebreaking have meant in human history in a single comprehensive account, astonishing in its scope and enthralling in its execution. Hailed upon first publication as a book likely to become the definitive work of its kind, &lt;i&gt;The Codebreakers&lt;/i&gt; has more than lived up to that prediction: it remains unsurpassed. With a brilliant new chapter that makes use of previously classified documents to bring the book thoroughly up to date, and to explore the myriad ways computer codes and their hackers are changing all of our lives, &lt;i&gt;The Codebreakers&lt;/i&gt; is the skeleton key to a thousand thrilling true stories of intrigue, mystery, and adventure. It is a masterpiece of the historian's art.</description>
