  <description>The spectacular finale to the New York Times bestselling trilogy that began with Mr. Mercedes (winner of the Edgar Award) and Finders Keepers—In End of Watch, the diabolical “Mercedes Killer” drives his enemies to suicide, and if Bill Hodges and Holly Gibney don’t figure out a way to stop him, they’ll be victims themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, something has awakened. Something evil. Brady Hartsfield, perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, where eight people were killed and many more were badly injured, has been in the clinic for five years, in a vegetative state. According to his doctors, anything approaching a complete recovery is unlikely. But behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake, and in possession of deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable havoc without ever leaving his hospital room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, now runs an investigation agency with his partner, Holly Gibney—the woman who delivered the blow to Hartsfield’s head that put him on the brain injury ward. When Bill and Holly are called to a suicide scene with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet, one that will put their lives at risk, as well as those of Bill’s heroic young friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back, and planning revenge not just on Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In End of Watch, Stephen King brings the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion, combining the detective fiction of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers with the heart-pounding, supernatural suspense that has been his bestselling trademark. The result is an unnerving look at human vulnerability and chilling suspense. No one does it better than King.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive history of America’s greatest incubator of innovation, the birthplace of some of the 20th century’s most influential technologies, including the integrated circuit, the communications satellite and the cell phone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs—officially, the research and development wing of AT&amp;amp;T—was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, it’s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn’t been touched by Bell Labs. &lt;br /&gt;Why did so many transformative ideas come from Bell Labs?  In &lt;i&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/i&gt;, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century’s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men—Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker—who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Their job was to research and develop the future of communications.  Small-town boys, childhood hobbyists, oddballs: they give the lie to the idea that Bell Labs was a grim cathedral of top-down command and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gertner brings to life the powerful alchemy of the forces at work behind Bell Labs inventions, teasing out the intersections between science, business, and society. He distills the lessons that abide: how to recruit and nurture young talent; how to organize and lead fractious employees; how to find solutions to the most stubbornly vexing problems; how to transform a scientific discovery into a marketable product, then make it even better, cheaper, or both. Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the origins of modern communications and the beginnings of the information age—a deeply human story of extraordinary men who were given extraordinary means—time, space, funds, and access to one another—and edged the world into a new dimension.</description>

  <description>What would happen if the world were ending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five thousand years later, their progeny—seven distinct races now three billion strong—embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision, Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable. As he did in Anathem, Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle, and Reamde, Stephenson explores some of our biggest ideas and perplexing challenges in a breathtaking saga that is daring, engrossing, and altogether brilliant.</description>

  <description>I am writing this book because I had a hard time learning Haskell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't have to be that way. I've spent the last couple years actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way, I started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques in Haskell that eventually turned into my guide for learning haskell. That experience led me to work on this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to programming entirely, Haskell is a great first language. You may have noticed the trend of "Functional Programming in [Imperative Language]" books and tutorials and learning Haskell gets right to the heart of what functional programming is. Languages such as Java are gradually adopting functional concepts, but most such languages were not designed to be functional languages, after all. We would not encourage you to learn Haskell as an only language, but because Haskell is a pure functional language, it is a fertile environment for mastering functional programming techniques. That way of thinking and problem solving is useful, no matter what other languages you might know or learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite. I'm now able to tackle problems that I couldn't have tackled when I was primarily a Clojure, Common Lisp, or Python user. Haskell is difficult to teach effectively.</description>

  <description>Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are you often busy but not productive?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the &lt;i&gt;Way of the Essentialist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting &lt;i&gt;only the right things&lt;/i&gt; done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a &lt;i&gt;systematic discipline&lt;/i&gt; for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything. A must-read for any leader, manager, or individual who wants to learn who to do less, but better, in every area of their lives, Essentialism  is a movement whose time has come.</description>

  <description>The computer and the internet are among the most important innovations of our era, but few people know who created them. They were not conjured up in a garret or garage by solo inventors suitable to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell, and Morse. Instead, most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively. There were a lot of fascinating people involved, some ingenious and a few even geniuses. This is the story of these pioneers, hackers, inventors, and entrepreneurs—who they were, how their minds worked, and what made them so creative. It’s also a narrative of how they collaborated and why their ability to work as teams made them even more creative.”</description>

      <![CDATA[This book describes "how a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution." It is a fascinating read about the stories behind many inventions. <br /><br />Several lessons can be learned from the book about how innovations come from ideas and what kind of thoughts and personalities are put into them. <br /><br />- Innovation is the result of collaboration. Ideas are built upon ideas. Innovation hardly comes from a sole genius.<br /><br />- The most productive team of innovators combines wide array of specialities: people with visionaries and people with strict management (Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore need to work with Andy Groove - Intel), people with excellent engineering skills (Steve Wozniak) and people with good product vision (Steve Jobs), theorists and experimentalist (Bell Labs), etc. <br /><br />- Although artificial intelligence is hot, there are still many years until a machine thinking on its own becomes a reality. Maybe a better alternative is augmented intelligence, where human and machine work together, each contributes its own strength (creativity, decision making from human and unlimited computing from machine) to produce much better innovation. This is the power of human-machine symbiosis. An example here is IBM Thomas Watson service. <br /><br />- As Steve Jobs said, "technology alone is not enough---that it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing."<br /><br />There is one thing I noted: the story line of the book is quite smooth to support several points that the author made in the book. The book tries to describe a lot of people and ideas in a limited number of pages, thus many technical details must have been overseen. However, this is still a good biography of the Digital Age; readers can learn about how technology are progressing and affecting their lives and their future. ]]>

They band together—some of them walking away from seven-figure salaries—to investigate, expose, and reform the insidious new ways that Wall Street generates profits. If you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you.</description>

      <![CDATA[ This is a story about how high frequency trade. It describes how HFT makes money of the US stock market by taking advantage of speed.<br /><br /> The protagonists are a group of people who step away from very high pay from major banks to restore fairness to the stock market.<br /><br /> There are couple of things I felt about the book when I was reading the book. One is Lewis doesn't give enough views from the other side (high frequency traders). The traders appear to be anonymous throughout the story. Second, the story becomes less interesting after the first half; it seems repetitive to me.<br /><br /> It turns out there are not good things that people talk about this book too. You can see them in some Goodreads users' reviews.<br /><br /><br />]]>

  <description>A decade ago, fourteen-year-old Suzanne Lombard, the daughter of Benjamin Lombard—then a senator, now a powerful vice president running for the presidency—disappeared in the most sensational missing-person case in the nation’s history. Still unsolved, the mystery remains a national obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legendary hacker and marine Gibson Vaughn, the case is personal—Suzanne Lombard had been like a sister to him. On the tenth anniversary of her disappearance, the former head of Benjamin Lombard’s security asks for Gibson’s help in a covert investigation of the case, with new evidence in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by tragic memories, he jumps at the chance to uncover what happened all those years ago. Using his military and technical prowess, he soon discovers multiple conspiracies surrounding the Lombard family—and he encounters powerful, ruthless political players who will do anything to silence him and his team. With new information surfacing that could threaten Lombard’s bid for the presidency, Gibson must stay one step ahead as he navigates a dangerous web to get to the truth.</description>

  <description>In the spirit of &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moneyball, Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; is both an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs—a real-life Tony Stark—and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American invention and its new "makers."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius’s life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vance uses Musk’s story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk—one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history—is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thorough and insightful, &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly and dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful and influential titans.</description>

  <description>If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Zero to One&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zero to One&lt;/i&gt; presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its driven, brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. Compared to tech's other elite innovators--Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg--Bezos is a private man. But he stands out for his restless pursuit of new markets, leading Amazon into risky new ventures like the Kindle and cloud computing, and transforming retail in the same way Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE EVERYTHING STORE will be the revealing, definitive biography of the company that placed one of the first and largest bets on the Internet and forever changed the way we shop and read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The success stories speak for themselves in this book from money maestro Dave Ramsey. Instead of promising the normal dose of quick fixes, Ramsey offers a bold, no-nonsense approach to money matters, providing not only the how-to but also a grounded and uplifting hope for getting out of debt and achieving total financial health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramsey debunks the many myths of money (exposing the dangers of cash advance, rent-to-own, debt consolidation) and attacks the illusions and downright deceptions of the American dream, which encourages nothing but overspending and massive amounts of debt. "Don't even consider keeping up with the Joneses," Ramsey declares in his typically candid style. "They're broke!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Total Money Makeover isn't theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to the heart of the money problems: you.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a very inspirational book about personal finance. And I highly recommend the audio book version, with motivational narration from Dave Ramsey himself. To a beginner to personal finance like me, this is a really good start: it shows how I have to be responsible with my own money, avoid debt, and how to allocate the money for all my goals in life. The interesting thing that it works for all people, but of course, it requires a huge amount of discipline, tenacity, and focus. Also, this is not only about the "Total money makeover", but also a "Life changer" in terms of how to think about the money. ]]>

  <description>Years after his escape, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's Inferno. Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.</description>

  <description>Will Graham stands in a silent, empty house communing with a killer. An FBI instructor with a gift for hunting madmen, Graham knows what his murderer looks like, how he thinks, and what he did to his victims after they died. Now Graham must try to catch him. But to do it, he must feel the heat of a killer's brain, draw on the macabre advice of a dangerous mental patient, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and follow a trail of microscopic clues to the place where another family has already been chosen to die--and where an innocent woman has found the Dragon first.</description>

  <description>Sheryl Sandberg’s &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt; is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</description>

  <description>The New Digital Age is the product of an unparalleled collaboration: full of the brilliant insights of one of Silicon Valley’s great innovators! What Bill Gates was to Microsoft and Steve Jobs was to Apple, Schmidt (along with Larry Page and Sergey Brin) was to Google. And, the Director of Google Ideas, Jared Cohen, formerly an advisor to both Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before has the future been so vividly and transparently imagined. From technologies that will change lives (information systems that greatly increase productivity, safety and our quality of life, thought controlled motion technology that can revolutionize medical procedures, and near-perfect translation technology that allows us to have more diversified interactions) to our most important future considerations (curating our online identity and fighting those who would do harm with it) to the widespread political change that will transform the globe (through transformations in conflict, increasingly active and global citizenries, a new wave of cyber-terrorism and states operating simultaneously in the physical and virtual realms) to the ever present threats to our privacy and security, Schmidt and Cohen outline in great detail and scope all the promise and peril awaiting us in the coming decades.</description>

  <description>Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by one of our best technology writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters—the Googleplex—to show how Google works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google’s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to Google’s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers—free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses—and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex.</description>
