  <description>I am writing this book because I had a hard time learning Haskell.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't have to be that way. I've spent the last couple years actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way, I started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques in Haskell that eventually turned into my guide for learning haskell. That experience led me to work on this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to programming entirely, Haskell is a great first language. You may have noticed the trend of "Functional Programming in [Imperative Language]" books and tutorials and learning Haskell gets right to the heart of what functional programming is. Languages such as Java are gradually adopting functional concepts, but most such languages were not designed to be functional languages, after all. We would not encourage you to learn Haskell as an only language, but because Haskell is a pure functional language, it is a fertile environment for mastering functional programming techniques. That way of thinking and problem solving is useful, no matter what other languages you might know or learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite. I'm now able to tackle problems that I couldn't have tackled when I was primarily a Clojure, Common Lisp, or Python user. Haskell is difficult to teach effectively.</description>

  <description>The spectacular finale to the New York Times bestselling trilogy that began with Mr. Mercedes (winner of the Edgar Award) and Finders Keepers—In End of Watch, the diabolical “Mercedes Killer” drives his enemies to suicide, and if Bill Hodges and Holly Gibney don’t figure out a way to stop him, they’ll be victims themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Room 217 of the Lakes Region Traumatic Brain Injury Clinic, something has awakened. Something evil. Brady Hartsfield, perpetrator of the Mercedes Massacre, where eight people were killed and many more were badly injured, has been in the clinic for five years, in a vegetative state. According to his doctors, anything approaching a complete recovery is unlikely. But behind the drool and stare, Brady is awake, and in possession of deadly new powers that allow him to wreak unimaginable havoc without ever leaving his hospital room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retired police detective Bill Hodges, the unlikely hero of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers, now runs an investigation agency with his partner, Holly Gibney—the woman who delivered the blow to Hartsfield’s head that put him on the brain injury ward. When Bill and Holly are called to a suicide scene with ties to the Mercedes Massacre, they find themselves pulled into their most dangerous case yet, one that will put their lives at risk, as well as those of Bill’s heroic young friend Jerome Robinson and his teenage sister, Barbara. Brady Hartsfield is back, and planning revenge not just on Hodges and his friends, but on an entire city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In End of Watch, Stephen King brings the Hodges trilogy to a sublimely terrifying conclusion, combining the detective fiction of Mr. Mercedes and Finders Keepers with the heart-pounding, supernatural suspense that has been his bestselling trademark. The result is an unnerving look at human vulnerability and chilling suspense. No one does it better than King.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive history of America’s greatest incubator of innovation, the birthplace of some of the 20th century’s most influential technologies, including the integrated circuit, the communications satellite and the cell phone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs—officially, the research and development wing of AT&amp;amp;T—was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, it’s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn’t been touched by Bell Labs. &lt;br /&gt;Why did so many transformative ideas come from Bell Labs?  In &lt;i&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/i&gt;, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century’s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men—Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker—who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Their job was to research and develop the future of communications.  Small-town boys, childhood hobbyists, oddballs: they give the lie to the idea that Bell Labs was a grim cathedral of top-down command and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gertner brings to life the powerful alchemy of the forces at work behind Bell Labs inventions, teasing out the intersections between science, business, and society. He distills the lessons that abide: how to recruit and nurture young talent; how to organize and lead fractious employees; how to find solutions to the most stubbornly vexing problems; how to transform a scientific discovery into a marketable product, then make it even better, cheaper, or both. Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/i&gt; is the story of the origins of modern communications and the beginnings of the information age—a deeply human story of extraordinary men who were given extraordinary means—time, space, funds, and access to one another—and edged the world into a new dimension.</description>

  <description>What would happen if the world were ending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five thousand years later, their progeny—seven distinct races now three billion strong—embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision, Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable. As he did in Anathem, Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle, and Reamde, Stephenson explores some of our biggest ideas and perplexing challenges in a breathtaking saga that is daring, engrossing, and altogether brilliant.</description>

  <description>Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Are you often busy but not productive?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the &lt;i&gt;Way of the Essentialist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting &lt;i&gt;only the right things&lt;/i&gt; done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a &lt;i&gt;systematic discipline&lt;/i&gt; for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything. A must-read for any leader, manager, or individual who wants to learn who to do less, but better, in every area of their lives, Essentialism  is a movement whose time has come.</description>

  <description>The computer and the internet are among the most important innovations of our era, but few people know who created them. They were not conjured up in a garret or garage by solo inventors suitable to be singled out on magazine covers or put into a pantheon with Edison, Bell, and Morse. Instead, most of the innovations of the digital age were done collaboratively. There were a lot of fascinating people involved, some ingenious and a few even geniuses. This is the story of these pioneers, hackers, inventors, and entrepreneurs—who they were, how their minds worked, and what made them so creative. It’s also a narrative of how they collaborated and why their ability to work as teams made them even more creative.”</description>

      <![CDATA[This book describes "how a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution." It is a fascinating read about the stories behind many inventions. <br /><br />Several lessons can be learned from the book about how innovations come from ideas and what kind of thoughts and personalities are put into them. <br /><br />- Innovation is the result of collaboration. Ideas are built upon ideas. Innovation hardly comes from a sole genius.<br /><br />- The most productive team of innovators combines wide array of specialities: people with visionaries and people with strict management (Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore need to work with Andy Groove - Intel), people with excellent engineering skills (Steve Wozniak) and people with good product vision (Steve Jobs), theorists and experimentalist (Bell Labs), etc. <br /><br />- Although artificial intelligence is hot, there are still many years until a machine thinking on its own becomes a reality. Maybe a better alternative is augmented intelligence, where human and machine work together, each contributes its own strength (creativity, decision making from human and unlimited computing from machine) to produce much better innovation. This is the power of human-machine symbiosis. An example here is IBM Thomas Watson service. <br /><br />- As Steve Jobs said, "technology alone is not enough---that it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing."<br /><br />There is one thing I noted: the story line of the book is quite smooth to support several points that the author made in the book. The book tries to describe a lot of people and ideas in a limited number of pages, thus many technical details must have been overseen. However, this is still a good biography of the Digital Age; readers can learn about how technology are progressing and affecting their lives and their future. ]]>

They band together—some of them walking away from seven-figure salaries—to investigate, expose, and reform the insidious new ways that Wall Street generates profits. If you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you.</description>

      <![CDATA[ This is a story about how high frequency trade. It describes how HFT makes money of the US stock market by taking advantage of speed.<br /><br /> The protagonists are a group of people who step away from very high pay from major banks to restore fairness to the stock market.<br /><br /> There are couple of things I felt about the book when I was reading the book. One is Lewis doesn't give enough views from the other side (high frequency traders). The traders appear to be anonymous throughout the story. Second, the story becomes less interesting after the first half; it seems repetitive to me.<br /><br /> It turns out there are not good things that people talk about this book too. You can see them in some Goodreads users' reviews.<br /><br /><br />]]>

  <description>A decade ago, fourteen-year-old Suzanne Lombard, the daughter of Benjamin Lombard—then a senator, now a powerful vice president running for the presidency—disappeared in the most sensational missing-person case in the nation’s history. Still unsolved, the mystery remains a national obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legendary hacker and marine Gibson Vaughn, the case is personal—Suzanne Lombard had been like a sister to him. On the tenth anniversary of her disappearance, the former head of Benjamin Lombard’s security asks for Gibson’s help in a covert investigation of the case, with new evidence in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haunted by tragic memories, he jumps at the chance to uncover what happened all those years ago. Using his military and technical prowess, he soon discovers multiple conspiracies surrounding the Lombard family—and he encounters powerful, ruthless political players who will do anything to silence him and his team. With new information surfacing that could threaten Lombard’s bid for the presidency, Gibson must stay one step ahead as he navigates a dangerous web to get to the truth.</description>

  <description>In the spirit of &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moneyball, Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; is both an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley’s most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs—a real-life Tony Stark—and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American invention and its new "makers."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius’s life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vance uses Musk’s story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk—one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history—is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thorough and insightful, &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt; brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly and dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful and influential titans.</description>

  <description>If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In &lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;Zero to One&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zero to One&lt;/i&gt; presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The definitive story of Amazon.com, one of the most successful companies in the world, and of its driven, brilliant founder, Jeff Bezos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com started off delivering books through the mail. But its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, wasn't content with being a bookseller. He wanted Amazon to become the everything store, offering limitless selection and seductive convenience at disruptively low prices. To do so, he developed a corporate culture of relentless ambition and secrecy that's never been cracked. Until now. Brad Stone enjoyed unprecedented access to current and former Amazon employees and Bezos family members, giving readers the first in-depth, fly-on-the-wall account of life at Amazon. Compared to tech's other elite innovators--Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg--Bezos is a private man. But he stands out for his restless pursuit of new markets, leading Amazon into risky new ventures like the Kindle and cloud computing, and transforming retail in the same way Henry Ford revolutionized manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE EVERYTHING STORE will be the revealing, definitive biography of the company that placed one of the first and largest bets on the Internet and forever changed the way we shop and read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The success stories speak for themselves in this book from money maestro Dave Ramsey. Instead of promising the normal dose of quick fixes, Ramsey offers a bold, no-nonsense approach to money matters, providing not only the how-to but also a grounded and uplifting hope for getting out of debt and achieving total financial health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ramsey debunks the many myths of money (exposing the dangers of cash advance, rent-to-own, debt consolidation) and attacks the illusions and downright deceptions of the American dream, which encourages nothing but overspending and massive amounts of debt. "Don't even consider keeping up with the Joneses," Ramsey declares in his typically candid style. "They're broke!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Total Money Makeover isn't theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to the heart of the money problems: you.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a very inspirational book about personal finance. And I highly recommend the audio book version, with motivational narration from Dave Ramsey himself. To a beginner to personal finance like me, this is a really good start: it shows how I have to be responsible with my own money, avoid debt, and how to allocate the money for all my goals in life. The interesting thing that it works for all people, but of course, it requires a huge amount of discipline, tenacity, and focus. Also, this is not only about the "Total money makeover", but also a "Life changer" in terms of how to think about the money. ]]>

  <description>Years after his escape, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's Inferno. Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.</description>

  <description>Will Graham stands in a silent, empty house communing with a killer. An FBI instructor with a gift for hunting madmen, Graham knows what his murderer looks like, how he thinks, and what he did to his victims after they died. Now Graham must try to catch him. But to do it, he must feel the heat of a killer's brain, draw on the macabre advice of a dangerous mental patient, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and follow a trail of microscopic clues to the place where another family has already been chosen to die--and where an innocent woman has found the Dragon first.</description>

  <description>Sheryl Sandberg’s &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt; is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women. The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lean In&lt;/i&gt;, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.</description>

  <description>The New Digital Age is the product of an unparalleled collaboration: full of the brilliant insights of one of Silicon Valley’s great innovators! What Bill Gates was to Microsoft and Steve Jobs was to Apple, Schmidt (along with Larry Page and Sergey Brin) was to Google. And, the Director of Google Ideas, Jared Cohen, formerly an advisor to both Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before has the future been so vividly and transparently imagined. From technologies that will change lives (information systems that greatly increase productivity, safety and our quality of life, thought controlled motion technology that can revolutionize medical procedures, and near-perfect translation technology that allows us to have more diversified interactions) to our most important future considerations (curating our online identity and fighting those who would do harm with it) to the widespread political change that will transform the globe (through transformations in conflict, increasingly active and global citizenries, a new wave of cyber-terrorism and states operating simultaneously in the physical and virtual realms) to the ever present threats to our privacy and security, Schmidt and Cohen outline in great detail and scope all the promise and peril awaiting us in the coming decades.</description>

  <description>Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by one of our best technology writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters—the Googleplex—to show how Google works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google’s earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to Google’s success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers—free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses—and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex.</description>

  <description>Are you doing all you can to further your career as a software developer? With today's rapidly changing and ever-expanding technologies, being successful requires more than technical expertise. To grow professionally, you also need soft skills and effective learning techniques. Honing those skills is what this book is all about. Authors Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye have cataloged dozens of behavior patterns to help you perfect essential aspects of your craft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Compiled from years of research, many interviews, and feedback from O'Reilly's online forum, these patterns address difficult situations that programmers, administrators, and DBAs face every day. And it's not just about financial success. &lt;i&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns&lt;/i&gt; also approaches software development as a means to personal fulfillment. Discover how this book can help you make the best of both your life and your career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Solutions to some common obstacles that this book explores in-depth include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burned out at work? "Nurture Your Passion" by finding a pet project to rediscover the joy of problem solving.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling overwhelmed by new information? Re-explore familiar territory by building something you've built before, then use "Retreat into Competence" to move forward again.&lt;br /&gt;Stuck in your learning? Seek a team of experienced and talented developers with whom you can "Be the Worst" for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "Brilliant stuff! Reading this book was like being in a time machine that pulled me back to those key learning moments in my career as a professional software developer and, instead of having to learn best practices the hard way, I had a guru sitting on my shoulder guiding me every step towards master craftsmanship. I'll certainly be recommending this book to clients. I wish I had this book 14 years ago!" -Russ Miles, CEO, OpenCredo</description>

  <description>The Fellowship was scattered. Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor–the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in The Return of the King.</description>

      <![CDATA[Simply great. I think this is a non-biased biography of Ho Chi Minh, a controversial figure in 20th century, not only to Vietnam and Vietnamese people, but also for the world history at that time. <br />Too many good details and they are highly linked together, so my only recommendation is read it ! ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Behind the bitter rivalry between Apple and Google—and how it’s reshaping the way we think about technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rise of smartphones and tablets has altered the business of making computers. At the center of this change are Apple and Google, two companies whose philosophies, leaders, and commercial acumen have steamrolled the competition. In the age of the Android and the iPad, these corporations are locked in a feud that will play out not just in the marketplace but in the courts and on screens around the world.&lt;br /&gt;     Fred Vogelstein has reported on this rivalry for more than a decade and has rare access to its major players. In &lt;i&gt;Dogfight&lt;/i&gt;, he takes us into the offices and board rooms where company dogma translates into ruthless business; behind outsize personalities like Steve Jobs, Apple’s now-lionized CEO, and Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman; and inside the deals, lawsuits, and allegations that mold the way we communicate. Apple and Google are poaching each other’s employees. They bid up the price of each other’s acquisitions for spite, and they forge alliances with major players like Facebook and Microsoft in pursuit of market dominance.&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;i&gt;Dogfight &lt;/i&gt;reads like a novel: vivid nonfiction with never-before-heard details. This is more than a story about what devices will replace our phones and laptops. It’s about who will control the content on those devices and where that content will come from—about the future of media in Silicon Valley, New York, and Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This book is good until the first half, when it talks about the tempting war between Apple and Google, or the war between their two famous mobile platforms: iPhone/iPad vs. Android. Many good stories have been told about people behind those two platforms, how Apple and Google competed with each other in design, advertising, technology features, patents.<br /><br />I am really impressed about how disruptive the iPad is. Must thank the author for giving me many insights about it. <br /><br />Some nice excerpts: <br /><br />- [When Android was a secret team inside Google] “The idea of a division inside Google that few even knew about was antithetical to its culture. ”<br /><br />- “They [Apple] don’t want people to be on their platform without permission. The benefit of a closed platform is control. But Google has a specific belief that open is the better approach because it leads to more options, competition, and consumer choices.”<br /><br />- [About Google doing advertisement] “this was not an easy adjustment for Google’s and Android’s very engineering-driven culture”<br /><br />- [How disruptive] “The iPod and iTunes changed the way people bought and listened to music. The iPhone changed what people could expect from their cell phones. But the iPad was turning five industries upside down.”<br /><br />- [Jobs's thought about why Bill Gates built such a bad tablet in 2003] “But he discovered Gates’s problem had less to do with a lack of imagination and more to do with the idea’s being ahead of the technology necessary to make it a reality”<br /><br />- [About Jobs and the iPad] “Thirty-five years after starting Apple with Steve Wozniak, Jobs was finally doing what he had set out to do all along: he was transforming what consumers and businesses expected from their computers. ”<br /><br />- “It [Android] allows its manufacturers to abandon the ecosystem”<br /><br />- “And during his two years as Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook has taken pains to point out that Jobs himself had made it clear to him that he didn’t want Cook running Apple the way he thought Jobs would want to but the way Cook thought it should be done.”<br /><br />The second part is rather disappointed. The author gave me an impression that after Jobs died, there are no more interesting stories to be told. The later parts, starting from chapter 8, is much more like fillers. It is mainly about the sue between Apple and Samsung, how the mobile platforms have changed the content provider industry, and the future for Apple and Google. But they are not as interesting as the first part. ]]>

      <![CDATA[A truly sad stories, as many people described this novel in Goodreads. <br />*SPOILER ALERT* <br />Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, two teenage cancer patients, fell in love with each other, and together they shared many views about life, the meaning of death,.. The last few sentences of the novel is the most strking to me, when Hazel read the last mail that Augustus had sent to Peter van Houten, telling him how much he loves her: <br /><br />Augustus [to van Houten] "You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man [Van Houten], but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers"<br />Hazel: "I do, Augustus.<br />I do"<br />...<br />A truly moving story, I must say that again. <br /><br />And I just knew that the author John Green is a Vlogger on vlogbrothers Youtube channels. I have subscribed to it, watched several videos of John and his brother Hank. Quite interesting, must see. ]]>

      <![CDATA[A very good introduction to finance to me. Several lessons can be learnt from this book and they also raised my awareness about personal finance. Of course these are only some fundamental points, but they are very inspiring.<br />Here are some tips: <br /><br />- Save 10% of all your income. <br />- Invest the money you save.<br />- Work hard to increase your income. <br />- If you are on debt, set 20% of all your income to cover your debt. <br /><br />Highly recommend for anyone who starts to think seriously about personal finance. ]]>

      <![CDATA[A famous classic of time management. Really recommend to who really wants to get things done, break habit of procrastination or being distracted. A light read, but Lakein's advices are really well-worth. <br />This one was read by President Clinton as he told on his autobiography "My life". His three timeline goals are: Have a wonderful political life, have a wonderful family, and write a book. You need such goals to really "get control of your time and your life" ]]>

      <![CDATA[Cuốn tiểu thuyết mới nhất của Daniel Silva về Gabriel Allon, gián điệp xuất chúng của cục tình báo Israel. Đây là tập truyện của Daniel Silva đầu tiên mà tôi đọc. Phong cách viết của ông khá cuốn hút, tuy nhiên trong tập 13 này tôi cảm thấy đối thoại là phần nhiều, không thấy được nhiều khả năng của Gabriel Allon. Truyện cũng có biến cố, tình tiết lên xuống, nhưng không đến mức quá cao trào, và cảm nhận chung là hơi dài. Thế nên tôi chỉ rate 4 sao cho tập này. <br /><br />Nhưng như lời khuyên của những người đọc khác trên Goodreads, không nên để The English Girl là tập duy nhất đọc trong loạt truyện về Gabriel Allon của Daniel Silva. Sẽ tiếp tục đọc về Gabriel Allon trong những phần trước. <br /><br />Đáng tiếc là truyện về Gabriel Allon chưa được dựng thành phim. Nếu có, phim nhất định sẽ hay ngang với loạt phim về Jack Ryan của Tom Clancy. ]]>

  <description>Jaron Lanier is the father of virtual reality and one of the world’s most brilliant thinkers. &lt;i&gt;Who Owns the Future?&lt;/i&gt; is his visionary reckoning with the most urgent economic and social trend of our age: the poisonous concentration of money and power in our digital networks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lanier has predicted how technology will transform our humanity for decades, and his insight has never been more urgently needed. He shows how Siren Servers, which exploit big data and the free sharing of information, led our economy into recession, imperiled personal privacy, and hollowed out the middle class. The networks that define our world--including social media, financial institutions, and intelligence agencies--now threaten to destroy it. In this provocative, poetic, and deeply humane book, Lanier charts a path toward a brighter future: an information economy that rewards ordinary people for what they do and share on the web.</description>

      <![CDATA[Vài nét về tác giả: Jaron Lanier là nhà nghiên cứu khoa học máy tính tại Microsoft Research, người tiên phong trong lĩnh vực Virtual Reality (thực tại ảo). Ông là người đồng sáng lập một số start-up, sau đó được Oracle, Adobe, Google mua lại. Ông cũng viết nhạc giao hưởng và chơi rất nhiều loại nhạc cụ hiếm. <br /><br />Trong cuốn sách thứ hai này (tiếp nối cuốn "You are not a gadget"), Lanier chỉ ra vấn đề với nền kinh tế dựa trên công nghệ số hiện nay, và đưa ra một tương lai mới để khắc phục những nhược điểm ấy. Một quyến sách rất hay: nói về công nghệ cao với kiến thức của một chuyên gia, nhưng không vì thế đưa công nghệ ra ngoài tầm với của con người mà ngược lại, tác giả thể hiện một sự quan tâm rất lớn đến con người: Một mai công nghệ phát triển vượt bậc, liệu con người có bị bỏ lại đằng sau? <br /><br />Với sự phát triển của công nghệ với tốc độ như hiện nay, sẽ xảy ra những vấn đề gì? Trước tiên là một tập hợp những Siren Server (từ do Lanier đặt), là những hệ thống Internet cực mạnh thu thập một lượng khổng lồ thông tin, lớn đến mức bẻ cong cả hệ thống kinh tế, hút về phía chúng. Những ví dụ dễ thấy ở đây là Google, Facebook, Amazon, ... những gã khổng lồ này đều có một hệ thống rất nhiều servers, chạy những thuật toán rất mạnh để dựa trên lượng information khổng lồ mà nó có tạo ra lợi nhuận. Những ngành khoa học máy tính như Big Data, High Performance Computing hiện nay đang rất hot, chính là để phục vụ cho xử lý lượng thông tin khổng lồ này để sinh ra giá trị, lợi nhuận. <br /><br />Bây giờ lấy một ví dụ, Google Translate. Bạn có thể up một câu tiếng Tây Ban Nha lên Google cloud, bạn sẽ nhận lại một câu tiếng Anh khá chuẩn. Có thể bạn nghĩ là có một hệ thống trí thông minh nhân tạo nào đó ẩn trên cloud kia có thể dịch thuật một cách chuẩn xác? Nhưng thực ra không phải. Điều thực sự xảy ra là: Google thu thập rất nhiều các ví dụ dịch thuật do người thật thực hiện. Sau đó, nó thực hiện tính tương quan giữa các mẫu ví dụ này với câu bạn muốn dịch, từ đó đưa ra câu dịch chấp nhận được. Đương nhiên, để thực hiện quá trình thống kê này đòi hỏi hệ thống máy tính rất mạnh chỉ Google mới có. Nhưng về căn bản, hoạt động dịch thuật vẫn dựa trên con người thật. Thế nhưng, những con người đó lại hoàn toàn bị ẩn đi, không nhận được bất cứ lợi nhuận nào cả. Vấn đề nằm ở đây. <br /><br />Trong tương lai. hầu như mọi thứ đều do máy tính làm. Máy in 3D hiện giờ đang rất phát triển, chẳng mấy chốc mọi thứ sẽ đều có thể in ra từ máy in 3D, chỉ cần có design. Tưởng tượng đến một ngày, quần áo bạn mặc cũng do máy in 3D in ra theo một mẫu thiết kế nào đó. Bạn mặc xong, không cần phải giặt ủi nữa, chỉ cần cho vào máy in 3D nghiền ra, in ra một mấu khác, bạn tiếp tục mặc (!) Những vật dụng khác, như bàn ghế, giường tủ, xe cộ, ... đều có thể được in ra. Vậy thì ngành công nghiệp chế tạo sẽ bị ảnh hưởng đáng kể, một lượng lớn việc làm sẽ bị mất đi, phải không? Công nghệ hiện nay đang tiệm cận đến "software-meditated technology", mọi công việc rồi sẽ chuyển dần từ hardware sang software cả. <br /><br />(Đến đây, tôi chợt nghĩ: Ít ra thì thức ăn cũng không thể in 3D được :)) ) <br /><br />Quay trở lại với hệ thống Siren Servers. Một điều đáng sợ là bây giờ con người đã phụ thuộc quá nhiều vào những hệ thống như vậy. Bạn nghĩ rằng bạn sẽ có thể bỏ hoàn toàn facebook? Khi mà hầu hết mọi người đều tham gia facebook, giao tiếp qua facebook thành một thói quen, bỏ facebook tức là bạn đã bỏ đi một phần rất lớn những mối quan hệ. Rất khó để có thể chấp nhận rủi ro như thế. <br /><br />Đó là một trong số những vấn đề mà Lanier nêu ra. Bên cạnh đó, còn nhiều vấn đề khác như phân bố giàu nghèo, độc quyền, ... mà tác giả trình bày trong nửa đầu cuốn sách <br /><br />Vậy để giải quyết vấn đề này, tác giả đề ra giải pháp nào? Trong nửa sau của cuốn sách, Lanier trình bày một mô hình gọi là humanistic information economy, trong đó dù công nghệ có phát triển đến đâu, con người vẫn là trung tâm. Ông đề ra hệ thống micropayment, ở đó mỗi người đều sẽ được trả lại một phần tiền dựa trên thông tin mà họ cung cấp cho Internet, nếu thông tin đó được sử dụng ở phần nào đó khác. Quay trở lại những ví dụ trên, người dịch thuật sẽ được trả một phần tiền nhỏ nếu Google dùng câu của họ trong Google Translate, người đưa ra mấu thiết kế quần áo sẽ được trả tiền nếu ai đó dùng thiết kế của họ cho máy in 3D... Ý tưởng là Siren Servers sẽ không còn có thể sử dụng thông tin mà bạn cung cấp một cách miễn phí như hiện tại để sinh lợi nhuận cho chúng nữa. <br /><br />Lanier cũng chứng minh làm như vậy sẽ gây dựng lại tầng lớp middle-class đang dần mất đi do việc làm ngày bị mất đi do công nghệ. Xây dựng lại phân bố giai tầng xã hội theo phân bố bell-curve là cần thiết cho một xã hội vững bền. <br /><br />Đây là một quyển sách tầm nhìn về tương lai. Có những điều tác giả trình bày khiến bạn phải kinh ngạc, có những điều bạn cảm thấy khó có thể tin được. Và cách hệ thống xã hội tương lai vận hành mà Lanier đề ra thì lại càng khó tin hơn nữa. Nhưng vẫn là một cuốn sách hay, nên đọc, vì nó sẽ cho bạn thấy vấn đề gì đang tồn tại hiện nay, và thấy con người, trong mối tương quan với công nghệ phát triển nhanh chóng, sẽ như thế nào. ]]>

  <description>Like his father and grandfather before him, Kino is a poor diver, gathering pearls from the gulf beds that once brought great wealth to the kings of Spain and now provide Kino, Juana, and their infant son with meager subsistence. Then, on a day like any other, Kino emerges from the sea with a pearl as large as a sea gull’s egg, as “perfect as the moon.” With the pearl comes hope, the promise of comfort and of security…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story of classic simplicity, based on a Mexican folk tale, &lt;i&gt;The Pearl&lt;/i&gt; explores the secrets of man’s nature, greed, the darkest depths of evil, and the luminous possibilities of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25512303-the-sense-of-an-ending"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony Webster and his clique first met Adrian Finn at school. Sex-hungry and book-hungry, they would navigate the girl-less sixth form together, trading in affectations, in-jokes, rumour and wit. Maybe Adrian was a little more serious than the others, certainly more intelligent, but they all swore to stay friends for life.&lt;br /&gt;Now Tony is retired. He's had a career and a single marriage, a calm divorce. He's certainly never tried to hurt anybody. Memory, though, is imperfect. It can always throw up surprises, as a lawyer's letter is about to prove.</description>

      <![CDATA[Thực sự là một cuốn tiểu thuyết rất tuyệt. Không phải là một tác phẩm dài nhưng lại dày đặc những tư tưởng triết lý, và Julian Barnes đã thể hiện khả năng văn chương chính xác bậc thầy của mình. Từng ý tưởng cứ trở đi trở lại trong tác phẩm, trong những bài học lịch sử của thầy Joe Hunt Già khi Tony còn đi học, giờ trở về soi rọi lên Tony của 40 năm sau, khi ông đã đến đoạn kết của cuộc đời mình. <br />- "Lịch sử là những lời dối trá của kẻ chiến thắng" - Tony trả lời thầy Hunt và thầy chữa lại: "Đúng, tôi đã khá sợ là trò sẽ nói vậy. Ừ thì, miễn sao trò nhớ được rằng đó cũng là điều tự hoang tưởng của kẻ chiến bại."<br />- "Lịch sử là tính chắc chắn được sản sinh vào thời điểm những khiếm khuyết của trí nhớ gặp những thiếu sót của tư liệu" - câu trả lời rất hàn lâm của Adrian, và có thể nói đó là một tư tưởng chính xuyên suốt cuốn tiểu thuyết. Tony đã cố tìm một câu trả lời cho cái chết của Adrian, với khiếm khuyết của trí nhớ của mình, với thiếu sót về tư liệu (cuốn nhật kí của Adrian), để rồi đến một kết cục bất ngờ. Và Tony phát hiện ra, cho dù có sống hết cuộc đời, vẫn chẳng thể hiểu nổi cuộc đời này. <br /><br />Tôi thích sự ngắn gọn, chính xác và cách thể hiện ý tưởng của tác giả. ]]>

  <description>An acclaimed bestseller and international sensation, Patrick Suskind's classic novel provokes a terrifying examination of what happens when one man's indulgence in his greatest passion — his sense of smell — leads to murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the slums of eighteenth-century France, the infant Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born with one sublime gift — an absolute sense of smell. As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris, and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs. But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and fresh-cut wood. Then one day he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the "ultimate perfume" — the scent of a beautiful young virgin. Told with dazzling narrative brillance, Perfume is a hauntingly powerful tale of murder and sensual depravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Translated from the German by John E. Woods.</description>

  <description>The year is 1327. Franciscans in a wealthy Italian abbey are suspected of heresy, and Brother William of Baskerville arrives to investigate. When his delicate mission is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William turns detective. His tools are the logic of Aristotle, the theology of Aquinas, the empirical insights of Roger Bacon - all sharpened to a glistening edge by wry humor and a ferocious curiosity. He collects evidence, deciphers secret symbols and coded manuscripts, and digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey, where "the most interesting things happen at night."</description>

      <![CDATA[Tiểu thuyết quá tuyệt vời của giáo sư Umberto Eco. Dưới hình thức là một tiểu thuyết trinh thám, với 2 nhân vật như trong truyện Sherlock Holmes: thầy tu William dòng Francis như Sherlock Holmes và chú chủng sinh Adso dòng Benedict như một bác sĩ Watson, nhưng "Tên của đóa hồng" lại là một kho tàng kiến thức văn hóa, triết học, nghệ thuật và tôn giáo, được thể hiện qua tài kể chuyện xuất sắc của Umberto Eco. Không dễ đọc, nhưng chính những đoạn chiêm nghiệm, tranh luận giữa các nhân vật về ý muốn của Chúa, làm thế nào để đến được với Chúa, ... là những điều hấp dẫn tôi nhất. <br />Một cuốn sách dày, khá kinh viện, nhưng nó cho cảm giác mãn nguyện thật sự khi chìm đắm trong từng trang sách. 5 sao! ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br /&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed. Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

      <![CDATA[Tập cuối cùng của bộ ba The Hunger Games là cuộc nổi dậy lật đổ Capitol của Quận 13, xoay quanh hình tượng Húng nhại Katniss Everdeen. Tuy nhiên, phần lớn câu chuyện là những dòng cảm xúc của Katniss: dày vò, căm giận, thương đau, khủng hoảng,... mà Suzanne Collins đã thể hiện rất tốt (một lần nữa tôi phải khẳng định lại, từ tập 2). Viết về cuộc chiến tranh nhưng đến một lúc nào đó của cuốn truyện, người đọc không còn cảm thấy hứng thú vì ai thắng ai thua nữa, vì sau cùng chỉ còn lại nỗi đau: những người bạn như Finnick, Boggs cũng hi sinh, rồi em gái Prim của Katniss cũng chết... Sau những nỗi đau ấy, mới thực sự thấy nhẹ lòng khi Katniss bắt đầu một cuộc sống mới sau chiến tranh, sống cùng Peeta trên đất quận 12, từ cằn cỗi giờ dần dần tái sinh, và sản sinh ra một thế hệ trẻ con sẽ không phải hứng chịu nỗi đau của "Đấu trường sinh tử" nữa. ]]>

  <description>"The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you're willing to risk the consequences. " --from &lt;i&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age&lt;/i&gt;, by Paul Graham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age&lt;/i&gt;, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls "an intellectual Wild West."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.</description>

      <![CDATA[A collection of essays from Paul Graham, a programmer who strongly advocates LISP programming. This book provides deep insights into nerd's life, hacker, entrepreneurship, and, which I enjoy the most, programming language. Paul showed why LISP is "the most powerful programming language" by comparing it with many other programming language: C, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby. <br /><br />4 star only because the info is somehow out of date. <br /><br />Here is my quick notes:<br /><br />Chap 1. Reading about nerds in school made something inside me resonate.<br /><br />Chap 2. Hackers and Painters<br /> - Hacking and Painting have a lot in common.<br /> - "Computer Science" is not a good term<br /> - mathematicians - people in between - hackers <br /> - Universities and research labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers<br /> - One way to build great software is to start your own startup. but 2 problems: have to do so much besides write software, 2) not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that's interesting to write. <br /> ex: hacking programming languages doesn't pay as well as figuring out how to connect some company's legacy database to their web server. <br /> --&gt; Solution: day jobs. you have one kind of work you do for money, and another for love. <br /> - hackers learn to hack by doing<br /> - hackers start original, and get good, and scientists start good, and get original<br /> - hackers can learn to program by looking at good programs - not just what they do, but at the source code. <br /> - hackers should have empathy for users, readers. <br /><br />Chap 3. What you can't say<br /><br />Chap 4. Good Bad Attitude<br /><br />Chap 5. The Other Road Ahead<br /><br />Chap 6. How to make Wealth <br /><br />Chap 10. Programming Language Explained <br /><br />Chap 11. The Hundred-year Language <br /><br />Chap 12. Beating the Averages <br /><br />Chap 13. Revenge of the Nerds <br />- All languages are not equivalent<br />- Java, Perl, Python, Ruby<br />- Lisp - an effort to define a more convenient alternative to the Turing machine - John McCarthy<br />- 9 ideas of Lisp:<br /> + Conditionals<br /> + A function type<br /> + Recursion<br /> + Dynamic typing<br /> + Garbage-collection<br /> + Programs composed of expressions<br /> + A symbol type<br /> + A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.<br /> + The whole language there all the time. <br /><br />Chap 14. The Dream Language <br />- succintness is one place where statically typed language lose.<br /><br />Chap 15. Design and Research<br /><br />]]>

  <description>Rafael Sabatini (1875 - 1950) was an Italian/British writer of novels of romance and adventure. At a young age, Rafael was exposed to many languages. By the time he was 17, he was the master of five languages. He quickly added a sixth language - English - to his linguistic collection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a brief stint in the business world, Sabatini went to work as a writer. He wrote short stories in the 1890s, and his first novel came out in 1902. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabatini was a prolific writer; he produced a new book approximately every year. He consciously chose to write in his adopted language, because, he said, "all the best stories are written in English." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, he produced 31 novels, eight short story collections, six non-fiction books, numerous uncollected short stories, and a play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is best known for his world-wide bestsellers: 'The Sea Hawk' (1915), 'Scaramouche' (1921), 'Captain Blood' (1922) and 'Bellarion the Fortunate' (1926). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other famous works by Sabatini are 'The Lion's Skin' (1911), 'The Strolling Saint# (1913) and 'The Snare' (1917).</description>

  <description>Macon Leary is a travel writer who hates both travel and anything out of the ordinary. He is grounded by loneliness and an unwillingness to compromise his creature comforts when he meets Muriel, a deliciously peculiar dog-obedience trainer who up-ends Macon’s insular world–and thrusts him headlong into a remarkable engagement with life.</description>

  <description>Victor Cyprien, a French engineer currently living in the "Diamond Fields" of Griqualand, South Africa desires to marry the beautiful daughter of Mr. Watkins, a man who holds claims to the land that are the "Diamond Fields." Watkins has other plans for his daughter, which includes her staying in South Africa and marrying one of the wealthier diamond miners. To put himself in a better position to win the hand of Alice, Victor buys a share and begins working his own claim. However, Alice convinces him to return to chemistry and pursue his theory that he can synthesize a diamond. The experiment appears to work as a 243-carat diamond is created and named "The Star of the South," which he gives to Alice. When the diamond is stolen, Cyprien and three other potential suitors for the hand of Alice, travel across South Africa in pursuit of the suspected culprit.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />Tiểu thuyết của Jules Verne, tuy không nổi tiếng bằng "Hai vạn dặm dưới biển", "Cuộc du hành vào lòng đất", nhưng cũng đầy lôi cuốn. Cũng là tiểu thuyết đầu tiên của Jules Verne mà tôi đọc nên cảm thấy rất thích cách kể chuyện của ông. <br /><br />Cyprien Mere, một kĩ sư hóa học người Pháp, đến tìm hiểu việc khai thác kim cương tại "Cánh đồng kim cương" ở Griqualand, Nam Phi. Chàng muốn cầu hôn tiểu thư Alice, con gái của John Watkins, chủ của khu đất khai thác kim cương. Nhưng John Watkins chỉ có kế hoạch gả con gái của mình cho thợ mỏ kim cương giàu có nhất. Để đủ khả năng cầu hôn Alice, Cyprien đã thuê một khu đất khai thác kim cương, mong có cơ hội tìm ra viên kim cương giá trị nhất. Nhưng sau nhiều vất vả không thấy kết quả, cùng với lời Alice khuyên chàng trở lại với hóa học, Cyprien bắt tay vào nghiên cứu quy trình chế tác kim cương nhân tạo. Thật bất ngờ, thí nghiệm đầu tiên của chàng đã cho ra kết quả không ngờ: một viên kim cương 243-cara tuyệt đẹp. Nó được đặt tên "Ngọc phương Nam" và là món quà Cyprien tặng Alice. Nhưng khi viên kim cương giá trị bị mất, Cyprien đã cùng 3 người đồng hành, cũng là 3 tên cạnh tranh cầu hôn Alice, bước vào một cuộc du hành truy tìm viên kim cương, cuộc du hành đầy kì thú, vất vả, và có đủ âm mưu, toan tính ... <br /><br />Jules Verne đã thể hiện hình ảnh một nhà khoa học đích thực ở Cyprien, người nhìn viên kim cương chỉ đơn giản là cacbon kết tinh, người cương quyết đưa ra phát minh của mình phục vụ cho khoa học dù cho bị đám thợ mỏ đe dọa vì phát minh đó sẽ giảm giá trị của kim cương. Chính sự tốt bụng, nhân hậu, giàu nhiệt huyết cho khoa học mà Cyprien đã có những người bạn đồng hành vô giá: hai chú bé da đen Matakit, Barkit, anh chàng Trung Hoa Lee. Và một kết cục có hậu cho chàng: được thừa hưởng cả một khu mỏ giàu có, và có được nàng Alice xinh đẹp. <br />]]>

  <description>THINGS FALL APART tells two overlapping, intertwining stories, both of which center around Okonkwo, a “strong man” of an Ibo village in Nigeria. The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second story, which is as modern as the first is ancient, and which elevates the book to a tragic plane, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world through the arrival of aggressive, proselytizing European missionaries. These twin dramas are perfectly harmonized, and they are modulated by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul. THINGS FALL APART is the most illuminating and permanent monument we have to the modern African experience as seen from within.</description>

  <description>They carried malaria tablets, love letters, 28-pound mine detectors, dope, illustrated bibles, each other. And if they made it home alive, they carried unrelenting images of a nightmarish war that history is only beginning to absorb. Since its first publication, &lt;i&gt;The Things They Carried&lt;/i&gt; has become an unparalleled Vietnam testament, a classic work of American literature, and a profound study of men at war that illuminates the capacity, and the limits, of the human heart and soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Things They Carried depicts the men of Alpha Company: Jimmy Cross, Henry Dobbins, Rat Kiley, Mitchell Sanders, Norman Bowker, Kiowa, and the character Tim O’Brien, who has survived his tour in Vietnam to become a father and writer at the age of forty-three.</description>

      <![CDATA["Những thứ họ mang" là câu chuyện về cuộc chiến Việt Nam, qua góc nhìn và trải nghiệm của đại đội bộ binh Alpha của Tim O' Brien. Điều hấp dẫn của tập truyện ngắn là khả năng khắc họa những nỗi niềm chân thật của con người, bao gồm nỗi đau, sự thù hận, nỗi sợ, nỗi cô đơn và cả sự hèn nhát ... <br /><br />Không có hình tượng anh hùng hay những chiến công phi thường nào cả, chỉ có những câu chuyện hành quân vô mục đích, chịu đựng cái nóng, cái bẩn, cái bênh tật ở chiến trường Việt Nam. Mỗi người lính trong đại đội Alpha đều là những con người bình thường. Thiếu úy Jimmy Cross, chỉ huy đại đội, không ngừng ám ảnh vì quyết định của mình đã gây ra cái chết của một binh lính dưới quyền. Chuột Kiley, quân y, người đã hết lòng chữa trị vết thương cho đồng đội, cuối cùng cũng vì nỗi ám ảnh về cái chết xảy ra với bạn bè mình, ngay cả khi họ còn sống, đã bỏ cuộc. Kiowa, một người ngoan đạo, chết vì đạn pháo rồi ngập sâu trong bùn. Norman Bowker, không ngừng ám ảnh vì mình đã không cứu được Kiowa. Tim O'Brien, sau 2 lần bị lãnh đạn phải rời rừng rú về làm công việc hậu phương, nhưng cũng vì thế mà cảm giác bị bỏ rơi, rồi trở nên thù hận… <br /><br /> Truyện cũng mang tính ám ảnh rất cao, khi các truyện ngắn thực ra là những câu chuyện được trở đi trở lại nhiều lần, dưới nhiều góc nhìn khác nhau, và mỗi góc nhìn là một cảm nhận riêng về cuộc chiến tranh này. Tim O'Brien đã làm tốt việc làm ta cảm nhận được cần phải tưởng tượng như thế nào về thực tế của cuộc chiến tranh ấy. <br /><br />]]>

  <description>In the “stifling heat of equatorial Newark,” a terrifying epidemic is raging, threatening the children of the New Jersey city with maiming, paralysis, lifelong disability, and even death. This is the startling theme of Philip Roth’s wrenching new book: a wartime polio epidemic in the summer of 1944 and the effect it has on a closely knit, family-oriented Newark community and its children. At the center of &lt;i&gt;Nemesis&lt;/i&gt; is a vigorous, dutiful twenty-three-year-old playground director, Bucky Cantor, a javelin thrower and weightlifter, who is devoted to his charges and disappointed with himself because his weak eyes have excluded him from serving in the war alongside his contemporaries. Focusing on Cantor’s dilemmas as polio begins to ravage his playground—and on the everyday realities he faces—Roth leads us through every inch of emotion such a pestilence can breed: the fear, the panic, the anger, the bewilderment, the suffering, and the pain. Moving between the smoldering, malodorous streets of besieged Newark and Indian Hill, a pristine children’s summer camp high in the Poconos—whose “mountain air was purified of all contaminants”—Roth depicts a decent, energetic man with the best intentions struggling in his own private war against the epidemic. Roth is tenderly exact at every point about Cantor’s passage into personal disaster, and no less exact about the condition of childhood. Through this story runs the dark questions that haunt all four of Roth’s late short novels, &lt;i&gt;Everyman, Indignation, The Humbling,&lt;/i&gt; and now &lt;i&gt;Nemesis:&lt;/i&gt; What kind of accidental choices fatally shape a life? How does the individual withstand the onslaught of circumstance?</description>

  <description>I’ve lost it. :( The only thing in the world I wasn’t supposed to lose. My engagement ring. It’s been in Magnus’s family for three generations. And now the very same day his parents are coming, I’ve lost it. The very same day! Do not hyperventilate, Poppy. Stay positive :) !!&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Poppy Wyatt has never felt luckier. She is about to marry her ideal man, Magnus Tavish, but in one afternoon her “happily ever after” begins to fall apart. Not only has she lost her engagement ring in a hotel fire drill but in the panic that follows, her phone is stolen. As she paces shakily around the lobby, she spots an abandoned phone in a trash can. Finders keepers! Now she can leave a number for the hotel to contact her when they find her ring. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Well, perfect except that the phone’s owner, businessman Sam Roxton, doesn’t agree. He wants his phone back and doesn’t appreciate Poppy reading his messages and wading into his personal life.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; What ensues is a hilarious and unpredictable turn of events as Poppy and Sam increasingly upend each other’s lives through emails and text messages. As Poppy juggles wedding preparations, mysterious phone calls, and hiding her left hand from Magnus and his parents . . . she soon realizes that she is in for the biggest surprise of her life.</description>

  <description>Open &lt;i&gt;Absurdistan&lt;/i&gt; and meet outsize Misha Vainberg, son of the 1,238th-richest man in Russia, lover of large portions of food and drink, lover and inept performer of rap music, and lover of a South Bronx Latina whom he longs to rejoin in New York City, if only the American INS will grant him a visa. But it won't, because Misha's late Beloved Papa whacked an Oklahoma businessman of some prominence. Misha is paying the price of exile from his adopted American homeland. He's stuck in Russia, dreaming of his beloved Rouenna and the Oz of NYC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salvation may lie in the tiny, oil-rich nation of Absurdistan, where a crooked consular officer will sell Misha a Belgian passport. But after a civil war breaks out between two competing ethnic groups and a local warlord installs hapless Misha as Minister of Multicultural Affairs, our hero soon finds himself covered in oil, fighting for his life, falling in love, and trying to figure out if a normal life is still possible in the twenty-first century. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Populated by curvaceous brown-eyed beauties, circumcision-happy Hasidic Jews, a loyal manservant who never stops serving, and scheming oil execs from a certain American company whose name rhymes with Malliburton, &lt;i&gt;Absurdistan&lt;/i&gt; is a strange, oddly true-to-life look at how we live now, from a writer who should know.</description>

  <description>Dr. Amin Jaafari, an Arab-Israeli citizen, is a surgeon at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Dedicated to his work, respected and admired by his colleagues and community, he represents integration at its most successful. He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife’s body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared. &lt;br /&gt;From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion, &lt;i&gt;The Attack&lt;/i&gt; portrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs. Intense and humane, devoid of political bias, hatred, and polemics, it probes deep inside the Muslim world and gives readers a profound understanding of what seems impossible to understand.</description>

      <![CDATA[Đây là tự truyện của một PhD student sau khi tốt nghiệp khoa CS ở Stanford. Very insightful about the process!! Philip Guo đã làm rất tốt việc miêu tả quá trình làm PhD đầy gian khổ nhưng cũng đầy thỏa mãn. Như tác giả nói: "It [the PhD] was fun at times, but more importantly, it was fulfilling".<br /><br />Những point nổi bật mà tác giả đã nêu (20 of the most memorable lessons) : <br /><br />- Đê thành công ở PhD nhất định phải có kết quả. Philip tốt nghiệp PhD CS vì anh ta đã sản sinh ra 5 prototype tool và hàng chục publish papers. PhD is not for "students with the most idealistic of intentions - dreamy and passionate hopes of revolutionizing their field - who produce few results and then end up disillusioned" <br /><br />- PhD thành công không phải vì read cực nhiều publication on the field. Philip rơi vào trap này vào năm thứ nhất khi anh đọc hàng trăm bài báo không vì mục đích cụ thể nào cả. Ngược lại, đọc paper rất có lợi trong trường hợp đã tìm được project cho mình, đi tìm những related word để xác định competitors, cũng như thêm những idea vào trong project của mình. <br /><br />- Phải có cách tìm relevant information riêng. Không phải lúc đi học trong lớp, không texbooks, không lecture notes, không instructors. Giờ đây, làm PhD là kiếm info trong research paper, trong một đoạn code, một website đâu đó, và ở trong cả trong đầu ai đó mà ta phải tìm ra và hỏi giúp đỡ. <br /><br />- Phải biết cách tạo ra cơ hội. Philip đã làm rất nhiều việc - giving talks, chatting with collegues,asking for and offering helps, and expressing gratitudes. Từ đó mà dẫn đến nhiều cơ hội, như tìm đến được Fernado ở UCB để được inspired làm ra IncPy, rồi việc gặp gỡ, follow up, và cuối cùng là cơ hội làm việc với Margo ở Harvard làm ra Burrito. <br /><br />- Phải biết luật chơi của "academic game", bị rất nhiều lần rejection trước khi biết cách publish hiệu quả. <br /><br />- Biết động lưc, tính cách của các PhD students khác, của các profs, và senior collegues, từ đó mà biết tận dụng, dẫn dắt họ theo hướng của mình. <br /><br />- Profs are human. <br /><br />- Làm những nhiệm vụ bắt buộc. Với những PhD student mới, việc "pay some dues" là rất cần thiết, thay vì chỉ đạo ngay từ những ngày đầu tiên. Nhiệm vụ ở đây nghĩa là work on research projects của supervisor. <br /><br />- Biết cách reject bad defaults. Ở memoir của Philips, default ở đây là làm việc liên tục theo project Klee của Dawson. Philip đã thử rất lâu nhưng không có kết quả. Defaults aren't usually in the best interests of those on the bottom (e.g. PhD students) so it's important to know when to reject them and to ask for something different. <br /><br />- Biết khi nào nên quit. Như philip quit Klee thì mới có cơ hội làm ra IncPy, SlopPy,CDE, ProWranglerProWrangler, Burrito <br /><br />- Recover from failures. Câu này Philip viết rất hay: "Grad school was a safe environment to practice recov-<br />ering from failures, since the stakes were low compared to failing in real jobs"<br /><br />- Tìm và hợp tác với những insiders, là những người đã thông thuộc hết những tricks ở trong một subfield, do đó hơp tác với họ dễ publish hơn. <br /><br />- Give many talks: là nơi để sản sinh ra những cơ hội hợp tác.<br /><br />- Sell, sell, sell: thousands of hours of hard grinding would go to waste if I failed to properly pitch the<br />big-picture signi�cance of my research to my target audience. Dịch nôm na là làm ngon là chưa đủ, phải biết cách marketing ! <br /><br />- Hào phóng giúp đỡ.<br /><br />- Tìm sự giúp đỡ đúng nơi. <br /><br />- Biết cách thể hiện sự biết ơn. <br /><br />- Ideas are always built upon other ideas. <br /><br />- Grind hard and smart: ở đây Philip đã viết rằng mình đã grind đủ 10000 giờ trong quá trình làm Ph.D (là con số mà làm cho một người trở thành expert một thứ gì đó, xem trong Những kẻ xuất chúng - Malcomm Gladwell). Nhưng grind hard nhưng cũng phải grind smart. "It's sad to see students blindly<br />working themselves to death on tasks that won't get favorable re-sults: approaching a research problem from an unwise angle, using the wrong kinds of tools, or doing useless errands."<br /><br />----<br /><br />Một cuốn tự truyện dễ đọc, nhưng cũng nhiều thông tin hữu ích về một quá trình - The Ph.D. Thanks Philip! ]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A man and a woman meet by chance while returning to their homeland, which they had abandoned twenty years earlier when they chose to become exiles. Will they manage to pick up the thread of their strange love story, interrupted almost as soon as it began and then lost in the tides of history? The truth is that after such a long absence "their memories no longer match." We always believe that our memories coincide with those of the person we loved, that we experienced the same thing. But this is just an illusion. Then again, what can we expect of our weak memory? It records only "an insignificant, minuscule particle" of the past, "and no one knows why it's this bit and not any other bit." We live our lives sunk in a vast forgetting, a fact we refuse to recognize. Only those who return after twenty years, like Odysseus returning to his native Ithaca, can be dazzled and astounded by observing the goddess of ignorance firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milan Kundera is the only author today who can take such dizzying concepts as absence, memory, forgetting, and ignorance, and transform them into material for a novel, masterfully orchestrating them into a polyphonic and moving work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Biography: The Franco-Czech novelist Milan Kundera was born in Brno and has lived in France, his second homeland, for more than twenty years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the author of the novels &lt;i&gt;The Joke, Life Is Elsewhere, The Farewell Party, The Books of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Immortality,&lt;/i&gt; and the short story collection &lt;i&gt;Laughable Loves&lt;/i&gt;, all originally written in Czech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;Slowness,&lt;/i&gt; his two earlier nonfiction works, &lt;i&gt;The Art ofthe Novel&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Testaments Betrayed,&lt;/i&gt; were originally written in French.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Truyện của Kundera mang tính triết học suy lý quá cao, vì thế cũng không dễ đọc. Nhưng phải công nhận khả năng diễn tả những nội dung phức tạp như nỗi nhớ, lãng quên, vô tri, ... của tác giả là rất xuất sắc. Đọc về Kundera thấy được review thế này: Milan Kundera is the only author today who can take such dizzying concepts as absence, memory, forgetting, and ignorance, and transform them into material for a novel, masterfully orchestrating them into a polyphonic and moving work. Phải nói là chuẩn xác. ]]>

  <description>Tập truyện ngắn của Phan Việt – một tác giả sinh ra và lớn lên ở Việt Nam, có bằng tiến sĩ Đại học Chicago và hiện là Phó Giáo sư Đại học South Carolina – với 15 truyện ngắn được chia thành 02 phần: Nước Mỹ, nước Mỹ và Những truyện ngắn bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xuất bản lần đầu tiên năm 2009, “Nước Mỹ, nước Mỹ” được đông đảo bạn đọc yêu thích. Ngay từ truyện ngắn mở đầu, tác giả đã khiến bạn đọc nghẹt thở với tự thú của một nhân vật: "Lúc 20 tuổi và ở Hà Nội, tôi không bao giờ tưởng tượng cuộc sống của tôi như thế này. Tôi không bao giờ tưởng tượng tuổi 30 của tôi đầy những giấc mơ bị virus máy tính săn đuổi và màn hình máy tính nổ vào mặt. Tôi không nghĩ tôi sẽ làm tình trên ghế sau một chiếc Honda Civic hai cửa với một người đàn bà tóc vàng tôi thậm chí không thích và là bạn của vợ tôi. Tôi không bao giờ nghĩ tôi sẽ pha cà phê trong một căn hộ ở Chicago, vừa chờ học sinh làm bài tập xác suất vừa mơ màng đến việc sẽ làm tình với học sinh trong tiếng nhạc Madam Butterfly"... (Nước Mỹ, nước Mỹ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Đề tài xuyên suốt của "Nước Mỹ, nước Mỹ" không chỉ là tình yêu hay hạnh phúc gia đình, là cuộc sống lưu học sinh hay chuyện việc làm, thất nghiệp, mức độ hòa nhập của người nhập cư ở Mỹ mặc dù trong đó ngồn ngộn những vấn đề mà người Việt (và không chỉ người Việt) ở nước ngoài hay người Việt hồi hương phải đối mặt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Điều có thể đọc được ở đây mong manh hơn rất nhiều, ẩn sau những dòng miêu tả những con người đi bên nhau trong cuộc đời này, có nhau mà vẫn cô độc, không có ràng buộc tinh thần hay ràng buộc lỏng lẻo, hoặc chất kết dính của mối quan hệ đã dần rời rã sau những ngày, những tháng, những năm cố gắng tìm một sự ổn định nơi xứ người ("Một chốn gọi là nhà"; "Nước Mỹ, nước Mỹ"; "Tiệc cuối năm tệ nhất trên đời").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cô độc bên cạnh những tiện nghi làm nên cuộc sống của họ, là tivi, điện thoại, hộp thư điện tử. Cô độc đến độ thờ ơ với đức tin, với những giá trị tinh thần vốn lại là niềm tin sâu sắc, sôi nổi của một người nghèo khó (Chúa ở đâu?), đến độ khó có gì khiến họ ngạc nhiên hay vui sướng, họ “khơi khơi sống, không cần bận tâm đến cái gì hay ai khác”, không cần tính điều gì xa hơn (Ái khanh ơi ái khanh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 truyện ngắn mô tả nhiều khía cạnh khác nhau trong đời sống của những người xa xứ xoay quanh tâm điểm: “Cần quá nhiều nhận thức và dũng cảm để sống một cuộc sống thật sự trong thế giới này”. Điều đọng lại với người đọc chính là: Trong hành trình đi tìm hạnh phúc, dù ở bất cứ nơi đâu, con người rồi sẽ tìm được hạnh phúc nếu tin vào bản thân và kiên định với con đường mình đã chọn.</description>

      <![CDATA["Cần quá nhiều nhận thức và dũng cảm để sống một cuộc sống thật sự trong thế giới này"<br />Mình mua tập truyện ngắn này vì cái tiêu đề Nước Mỹ nước Mỹ, vì muốn tìm hiểu xem cuộc sống của người Việt ở xứ sở xa xôi ấy như thế nào. Phong cách viết văn của Phan Việt rất nhẹ nhàng và không có quá nhiều kịch tính. Nhưng mỗi câu chuyện là một sắc màu riêng, là những khắc họa rất chân thật về những cảm xúc của những con người sang Mỹ để tìm sự thỏa mãn về nghiên cứu học thuật, hoặc tìm một con đường để thành công về sự nghiệp. Ở đó có những tháng ngày thất vọng, chán chường tự hỏi mục đích cuộc đời của mình là gì, có những mối quan hệ vợ chồng đã không còn mộng mơ, dần bị cuộc sống nước Mỹ làm phai nhạt dần, nhưng họ vẫn gắn bó với nhau trên đất nước xa xôi ấy, vân vân...<br />Đọc thấy thỏa mãn. Đã phần nào thấy được điều gì đang đợi mình trước mắt. ]]>

  <description>Frodo Baggins knew the Ringwraiths were searching for him—and the Ring of Power he bore that would enable Sauron to destroy all that was good in Middle-earth. Now it was up to Frodo and his faithful servant Sam to carry the Ring to where it could be destroyed—in the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom.</description>

      <![CDATA[Đã xem phải đến vài ba lần bộ phim Lord of the Rings mà vẫn thấy mê, nên mình lập tức phải mua ngay "Đoàn hộ nhẫn" khi Nhã Nam phát hành. Thấy trên mạng cãi nhau rất nhiều về cách chuyển ngữ của tác phẩm, khi dịch một số tên ra tiếng Việt. Lúc đầu mình cũng cảm thấy không quen, khi không biết Frodo Bao Gai là Frodo Baggins, Quận chính là xứ Shire của Hobbits, vân vân... Nhưng đọc một lúc rồi cũng nhớ và quen thuộc, lại quay ra thích cách dịch của Nhã Nam ấy :D Chắc mình cũng không phải cầu kì quá, với cả mình bị cuốn hút vào nội dung của truyện hơn. <br /><br />Quả thật xem phim đã hay, xem truyện càng thấy đã, vì biết bao nhiêu chi tiết vì lịch sử mà trong phim không thể thể hiện hết được đều được miêu tả kĩ càng trong truyện. Hiểu được thêm nhiều về nguồn gốc chiếc Nhẫn và hành trình của nó. <br /><br />Mong đợi được xem những phần tiếp theo ^^ ]]>

  <description>“For far too long, Afghan women have been faceless and voiceless. Until now. With &lt;i&gt;The Patience Stone&lt;/i&gt;, Atiq Rahimi gives face and voice to one unforgettable woman–and, one could argue, offers her as a proxy for the grievances of millions…it is a rich read, part allegory, part a tale of retribution, part an exploration of honor, love, sex, marriage, war.  It is without doubt an important and courageous book.” from the introduction by Khaled Hosseini, author of &lt;i&gt;The Kite Runner&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Thousand Splendid Suns&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In Persian folklore, Syngue Sabour is the name of a magical black stone, a patience stone, which absorbs the plight of those who confide in it. It is believed that the day it explodes, after having received too much hardship and pain, will be the day of the Apocalypse. But here, the Syngue Sabour is not a stone but rather a man lying brain-dead with a bullet lodged in his neck. His wife is with him, sitting by his side. But she resents him for having sacrificed her to the war, for never being able to resist the call to arms, for wanting to be a hero, and in the end, after all was said and done, for being incapacitated in a small skirmish. Yet she cares, and she speaks to him. She even talks to him more and more, opening up her deepest desires, pains, and secrets. While in the streets rival factions clash and soldiers are looting and killing around her, she speaks of her life, never knowing if her husband really hears. And it is an extraordinary confession, without restraint, about sex and love and her anger against a man who never understood her, who mistreated her, who never showed her any respect or kindness. Her admission releases the weight of oppression of marital, social, and religious norms, and she leads her story up to the great secret that is unthinkable in a country such as Afghanistan. Winner of the Prix Goncourt, &lt;i&gt;The Patience Stone &lt;/i&gt;captures with great courage and spare, poetic, prose the reality of everyday life for an intelligent woman under the oppressive weight of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</description>

  <description>L'Omnia 3 est un ordinateur de la toute dernière génération. Réalisé à partir de composants neurologiques, on peut le commander à la voix et à l'oeil. Il suffit de lui parler ou de fixer du regard une icône pour que l'écran s'anime. Sa puissance de calculs ou de mémoire étant par ailleurs phénoménale, il reste réservé à quelques initiés ou limité à des applications de haute technicité. Alors imaginez la surprise du commissaire Germain lorsqu'on découvre six honnêtes commerçants de Bergerac décédés face à l'écran de leur ordinateur. Seule piste exploitable, il s'agissait à chaque fois d'un Omnia 3. Le commissaire va devoir faire appel à la jeune et charmante Laure Gisèle dite "Logicielle" en raison de ses compétences en informatique. D'e-mail en rebondissements virtuels, Logicielle qui doit en même temps esquiver les avances de son collègue Max, saura-t-elle découvrir la terrible machination et l'homme qui se cache derrière ? &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;L'Ordinatueur&lt;/i&gt; est un livre palpitant, mêlant énigme et haute technologie de manière claire et explicative. Son auteur est l'un des grands spécialistes français de science-fiction et de romans policiers pour la jeunesse. À partir de 11 ans. &lt;i&gt;--Stellio Paris&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Bản tiếng Việt lấy tên "Máy tính sát thủ". Truyện đọc lúc đầu thì cảm giác rất hồi hộp, nhưng đến đoạn cuối thì có vẻ không còn kịch tính lắm. Do vậy, làm cho câu chuyện không được cuốn hút và để lại ấn tượng gì. ]]>

  <description>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“[This] may be as close as Vonnegut ever comes to a memoir.” &lt;br /&gt;–&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Like [that of] his literary ancestor Mark Twain, [Kurt Vonnegut’s] crankiness is good-humored and sharp-witted. . . . [Reading &lt;i&gt;A Man Without a Country&lt;/i&gt; is] like sitting down on the couch for a long chat with an old friend.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;–The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a volume that is penetrating, introspective, incisive, and laugh-out-loud funny, one of the great men of letters of this age–or any age–holds forth on life, art, sex, politics, and the state of America’s soul. From his coming of age in America, to his formative war experiences, to his life as an artist, this is Vonnegut doing what he does best: Being himself. Whimsically illustrated by the author, &lt;i&gt;A Man Without a Country&lt;/i&gt; is intimate, tender, and brimming with the scope of Kurt Vonnegut’s passions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“For all those who have lived with Vonnegut in their imaginations . . . this is what he is like in person.” &lt;br /&gt;–&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Filled with [Vonnegut’s] usual contradictory mix of joy and sorrow, hope and despair, humor and gravity.” &lt;br /&gt;–&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Fans will linger on every word . . . as once again [Vonnegut] captures the complexity of the human condition with stunning calligraphic simplicity.” &lt;br /&gt;–&lt;i&gt;The Australian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Thank God, Kurt Vonnegut has broken his promise that he will never write another book. In this wondrous assemblage of mini-memoirs, we discover his family’s legacy and his obstinate, unfashionable humanism.” &lt;br /&gt;–Studs Terkel</description>

  <description>Richard Feynman (1918-1988), winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures. Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; painting a naked female toreador - and much else of an eyebrow-raising nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, here is Feynman's life in all its eccentric glory - a combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br /&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br /&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/i&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

      <![CDATA[Một cuốn truyện phiêu lưu rất đáng đọc. Tiếp nối phần một, những tưởng Katniss sẽ không phải trở lại Đấu trường nữa, nhưng rồi cái nghiệt ngã của số phận đã đẩy cô dấn thân vào đó một lần nữa, với những Vật tế đã từng chiến thắng trong những lần thi đấu trước. Rất nhiều người chết, nhưng đấu trường này sẽ là đấu trường cuối cùng ở Panem. Vì đã đến lúc dân chúng ở Panem vùng lên khởi nghĩa... <br /><br />Suzanne Collins miêu tả tâm trạng của Katniss rất chân thực và đầy thuyết phục. Đó là tâm trạng của một cô gái trẻ còn đầy băn khoăn trước sự rắc rối của tình yêu và choáng ngợp trước bàn cờ chính trị. Nhưng sau tập 2 này, tôi nghĩ trong cuộc khởi nghĩa ở tập 3, Katniss sẽ có một hình ảnh khác, của người sẽ cầm đầu cuộc bạo loạn chống lại tổng thống Snow và Capitol.<br /><br />Mong đợi tập 3 :) ]]>

  <description>Impish, foul-mouthed Zazie arrives in Paris from the country to stay with her uncle Gabriel. All she really wants to do is ride the metro, but finding it shut because of a strike, Zazie looks for other means of amusement and is soon caught up in a comic adventure that becomes wilder and more manic by the minute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1960 Queneau's cult classic was made into a hugely successful film by Louis Malle. Packed full of word play and phonetic games, 'Zazie in the Metro' remains as stylish and witty as ever.</description>

  <description>"Steinbeck is an artist; and he tells the stories of these lovable thieves and adulterers with a gentle and poetic purity of heart and of prose." -- New York Herald Tribune&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adopting the structure and themes of the Arthurian legend, Steinbeck created a "Camelot" on a shabby hillside above the town of Monterey,California and peopled it with a colorful band of knights. At the center of the tale is Danny, whose house, like Arthur's castle, becomes a gathering place for men looking for adventure, camaraderie, and a sense of belonging. These "knights" are &lt;i&gt;paisanos&lt;/i&gt;, men of mixed heritage, whose ancestors settled California hundreds of years before. Free of ties to jobs and other complications of the American way of life, they fiercely resist the corrupting tide of honest toil in the surrounding ocean of civil rectitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Steinbeck chronicles their deeds--their multiple loves, their wonderful brawls, their Rabelaisian wine-drinking--he spins a tale as compelling and ultimately as touched by sorrow as the famous legends of the Round Table, which inspired him.</description>

  <description>With this, his first collection, Carver breathed new life into the short story. In the pared-down style that has since become his hallmark, Carver showed how humour and tragedy dwell in the hearts of ordinary people, and won a readership that grew with every subsequent brilliant collection of stories, poems and essays that appeared in the last eleven years of his life.</description>

      <![CDATA[Mình mua quyển này sau khi đọc review trên blog Goldmund của bác Lâm Vũ Thao. Phải công nhận Raymond Carver viết truyện ngắn rất ấn tượng. Những truyện ngắn trong tập "Em làm ơn im đi được không" này đều có điểm chung: suy nghĩ của các nhân vật không hề được thể hiện ra, nhưng trong cái cách họ thể hiện ra bằng hành động mình tự dưng cũng cảm nhận được suy nghĩ của họ. Carver tài tình ở chỗ đó, như lời trên bìa truyện: "Carver có một lòng cảm thông và trung thực lớn lao. Mắt ông nhìn thấu suốt khiến tim ta đau nhói." <br /><br />Một thằng bé có bố mẹ mâu thuẫn nhau, muốn tìm thấy tình thương mà bố mẹ vô tâm không nhận ra (Không ai nói gì). <br /><br />Một anh chàng bị phá sản phải nhờ vợ đi bán xe (Công tơ mét này có chạy đúng không?) <br /><br />Tâm trạng một anh chàng phát hiện vợ lăng nhăng sau hai năm (Em làm ơn im đi, được không) <br /><br />…<br /><br />Không dễ tìm thấy ý nghĩa đằng sau những câu chuyện này của Carver. Nhưng mình luôn thấy một sự cảm thông với nỗi niềm riêng của những nhân vật trong truyện.<br /><br />Một tập truyện ngắn nên đọc lại khi có dịp. ]]>

  <description>Suor Teodora narra la storia di Agilulfo, cavaliere senza corpo, di cui vive solo l'armatura. Mentre Carlo Magno assedia Parigi, Agilulfo, dopo essersi coperto di gloria, decide di partire alla ricerca di Sofronia, fanciulla da lui salvata quindici anni prima. Accompagnato dallo scudiero Gurdulù, attraverso numerose peripezie, inseguito dalla guerriera Bradamante innamorata di lui, Agilulfo riesce a trovare Sofronia, ma credendola macchiata di gravi peccati, decide di scomparire. Si sveste dell'armatura e la consegna a Rambaldo, giovane compagno d'armi. Sarà ora questi a proseguire nella bianca corazza, le gesta del cavaliere senza corpo.</description>

  <description>Il narratore rievoca la storia dello zio, Medardo di Torralba, che, combattendo in Boemia contro i Turchi, è tagliato a metà da un colpo di cannone. Le due parti del corpo, perfettamente conservate, mostrano diversi caratteri: la prima metà mostra un'indole crudele, infierisce sui sudditi e insidia la bella Pamela, mentre l'altra metà, quella buona, si prodiga per riparare ai misfatti dell'altra e chiede in sposa Pamela. I due viscconti dimezzati si sfidano a duello e nello scontro cominciano a sanguinare nelle rispettive parti monche. Un medico ne approfitta per riunire le due metà del corpo e restituire alla vita un visconte intero, in cui si mescolano male e bene.</description>

      <![CDATA["Tử tước chẻ đôi" - Italo Calvino <br />Cảm thấy thích phong cách viết văn trong "Nếu một đêm đông có người lữ khách" của Italo Calvino, tôi quyết định khuân bộ "Tổ tiên của chúng ta" của Nhã Nam về nghiền ngẫm xem. "Tử tước chẻ đôi" là câu chuyện đầu tiên trong 3 tập. <br /><br />Cảm giác đầu tiên của tôi là đây là một tập truyện rất ngắn. Tác giả cũng tâm sự tác giả muốn viết một câu chuyện mang tính giải trí, nên truyện khá dễ đọc. Nhưng tôi thích cách tác giả xây dựng hình ảnh chàng tử tước Medardo với hai nửa Thiện - Ác ấy. Đầu tiên là cái nửa Ác của chàng về quê nhà trước, tiếp quản lâu đài, rồi thực hiện rất nhiều điều tàn ác, khiên dân chúng căm tức. Thế rồi điều bất ngờ thứ hai xuất hiện khi cái nửa Thiện của Medardo cũng trở về, bắt đầu thực hiện những việc Thiện, giúp đỡ mọi người trong vùng. Đến đây, tôi những tưởng nửa Thiện này là hoàn hảo, sẽ vùng lên để lật đổ nửa Ác kia. Thế nhưng tác giả tài tình ở chỗ chỉ ra một cái nửa chỉ có Thiện thì cũng chẳng thể nào hoàn hảo. Thói tọc mạch, ham thuyết giảng của chàng Medardo-Thiện chẳng mấy chốc cũng bị dân chúng chán ghét. Họ "cảm thấy mình như thể bị mất hút giữa ác hiểm và đức hạnh, đều phi nhân như nhau" <br /><br />Hai cái nửa ấy suốt câu chuyện cứ tránh mặt nhau, rồi cũng vì một cô gái Pamela mà dẫn đến đoạn đấu kiếm. Kết cục cả hai đâm nhau bị thương, và thế là bác sĩ Trelawney có cơ hội nối hai nửa lại với nhau. Và chàng tử tước Medardo hoàn chỉnh đã trở lại, giờ chàng đã có kinh nghiệm của cả hai, Thiện và Ác, và như lời Pamela nói, nàng sung sướng vì "cuối cùng mình sẽ có một chú rể hội đủ mọi thuộc tính". Truyện kết thúc. <br /><br />Truyện khá ngắn, nhưng tôi thấy như vậy là vừa đủ, đủ để mang tính giải trí như tác giả mong đợi. Đọc truyện tôi thấy thích nhất những hình ảnh so sánh giữa hành động của Medardo-Thiện và Medardo-Ác, suy nghĩ của bác thợ cả về nên chế tạo cỗ máy phục vụ cái Thiện hay cái Ác. Một câu chuyện đẹp. Lại càng thấy thích phong cách văn chương độc đáo của Italo. <br /><br />]]>

  <description>Meet Forrest Gump, the lovable, herculean, and surprisingly savvy hero of this remarkable comic odyssey. After accidentally becoming the star of University of Alabama's football team, Forrest goes on to become a Vietnam War hero, a world-class Ping-Pong player, a villainous wrestler, and a business tycoon -- as he wonders with childlike wisdom at the insanity all around him. In between misadventures, he manages to compare battle scars with Lyndon Johnson, discover the truth about Richard Nixon, and survive the ups and downs of remaining true to his only love, Jenny, on an extraordinary journey through three decades of the American cultural landscape. Forrest Gump has one heck of a story to tell -- and you've got to read it to believe it....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An intimate journey across and in search of America, as told by one of its most beloved writers, in a deluxe centennial edition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Travels with Charley in Search of America&lt;/i&gt; is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—&lt;i&gt;Travels with Charley&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. </description>

  <description>Published on the eve of World War I, a decade after &lt;i&gt;Buddenbrooks&lt;/i&gt; had established Thomas Mann as a literary celebrity, &lt;i&gt;Death in Venice&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Gustav von Aschenbach, a successful but aging writer who follows his wanderlust to Venice in search of spiritual fulfillment that instead leads to his erotic doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the decaying city, besieged by an unnamed epidemic, he becomes obsessed with an exquisite Polish boy, Tadzio. "It is the story of the voluptuousness of doom," Mann wrote. "But the problem I had especially in mind was that of the artist's dignity."</description>

  <description>In this irreverent and illuminating book, acclaimed writer and scientist Leonard Mlodinow shows us how randomness, change, and probability reveal a tremendous amount about our daily lives, and how we misunderstand the significance of everything from a casual conversation to a major financial setback. As a result, successes and failures in life are often attributed to clear and obvious cases, when in actuality they are more profoundly influenced by chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rise and fall of your favorite movie star of the most reviled CEO--in fact, of all our destinies--reflects as much as planning and innate abilities. Even the legendary Roger Maris, who beat Babe Ruth's single-season home run record, was in all likelihood not great but just lucky. And it might be shocking to realize that you are twice as likely to be killed in a car accident on your way to buying a lottery ticket than you are to win the lottery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could it have happened that a wine was given five out of five stars, the highest rating, in one journal and in another it was called the worst wine of the decade? Mlodinow vividly demonstrates how wine ratings, school grades, political polls, and many other things in daily life are less reliable than we believe. By showing us the true nature of change and revealing the psychological illusions that cause us to misjudge the world around us, Mlodinow gives fresh insight into what is really meaningful and how we can make decisions based on a deeper truth. From the classroom to the courtroom, from financial markets to supermarkets, from the doctor's office to the Oval Office, Mlodinow's insights will intrigue, awe, and inspire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offering readers not only a tour of randomness, chance, and probability but also a new way of looking at the world, this original, unexpected journey reminds us that much in our lives is about as predictable as the steps of a stumbling man fresh from a night at the bar.</description>

  <description>When Jay Granger's ex-husband is seriously hurt in an accident, she is asked to confirm his identity at the hospital. But the man before her is almost unrecognizable from his injuries. Tentatively she identifies him as Steve Crossfield, the man she was once married to. When he awakens from his coma, Steve cannot remember anything of their life together. Is this the man Jay once loved intensely, or is she attracted to a complete stranger?</description>

  <description>Just as Norman Maclean writes at the end of "A River Runs through It" that he is "haunted by waters," so have readers been haunted by his novella. A retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70, Maclean produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American stories of the twentieth century. Originally published in 1976, &lt;i&gt;A River Runs through It and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt; now celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary, marked by this new edition that includes a foreword by Annie Proulx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maclean grew up in the western Rocky Mountains in the first decades of the twentieth century. As a young man he worked many summers in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. The two novellas and short story in this collection are based on his own experiences—the experiences of a young man who found that life was only a step from art in its structures and beauty. The beauty he found was in reality, and so he leaves a careful record of what it was like to work in the woods when it was still a world of horse and hand and foot, without power saws, "cats," or four-wheel drives. Populated with drunks, loggers, card sharks, and whores, and set in the small towns and surrounding trout streams and mountains of western Montana, the stories concern themselves with the complexities of fly fishing, logging, fighting forest fires, playing cribbage, and being a husband, a son, and a father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By turns raunchy, poignant, caustic, and elegiac, these are superb tales which express, in Maclean's own words, "a little of the love I have for the earth as it goes by." A first offering from a 70-year-old writer, the basis of a top-grossing movie, and the first original fiction published by the University of Chicago Press, &lt;i&gt;A River Runs through It and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt; has sold more than a million copies. As Proulx writes in her foreword to this new edition, "In 1990 Norman Maclean died in body, but for hundreds of thousands of readers he will live as long as fish swim and books are made."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Altogether beautiful in the power of its feeling... As beautiful as anything in Thoreau or Hemingway." —Alfred Kazin, &lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune Book World&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It is an enchanted tale... I have read the story three times now, and each time it seems fuller." —Roger Sale, &lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Maclean's book—acerbic, laconic, deadpan—rings out of a rich American tradition that includes Mark Twain, Kin Hubbard, Richard Bissell, Jean Shepherd, and Nelson Algren. I love its sound." —James R. Frakes, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The title novella is the prize... Something unique and marvelous: a story that is at once an evocation of nature's miracles and realities and a probing of human mysteries. Wise, witty, wonderful, Maclean spins his tales, casts his flies, fishes the rivers and the woods for what he remembers from his youth in the Rockies." —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ostensibly a 'fishing story,' 'A River Runs through It' is really an autobiographical elegy that captivates readers who have never held a fly rod in their hand. In it the art of casting a fly becomes a ritual of grace, a metaphor for man's attempt to move into nature." —Andrew Rosenheim, &lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>“One of our most exquisite storytellers” &lt;i&gt;(Esquire)&lt;/i&gt; gives us his first collection in over a decade: ten potent new stories that, along with twenty-one classics, display his mastery over a quarter century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tobias Wolff’s first two books, &lt;i&gt;In the Garden of the North American Martyrs&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Back in the World,&lt;/i&gt; were a powerful demonstration of how the short story can “provoke our amazed appreciation,” as &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; wrote then. In the years since, he’s written a third collection, &lt;i&gt;The Night in Question,&lt;/i&gt; as well as a pair of genre-defining memoirs &lt;i&gt;(This Boy’s Life&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Pharaoh’s Army),&lt;/i&gt; the novella &lt;i&gt;The Barracks Thief,&lt;/i&gt; and, most recently, a novel, &lt;i&gt;Old School.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he returns with fresh revelations—about biding one’s time, or experiencing first love, or burying one’s mother—that come to a variety of characters in circumstances at once everyday and extraordinary: a retired Marine enrolled in college while her son trains for Iraq, a lawyer taking a difficult deposition, an American in Rome indulging the Gypsy who’s picked his pocket. In these stories, as with his earlier, much-anthologized work, he once again proves himself, according to the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times,&lt;/i&gt; “a writer of the highest order: part storyteller, part philosopher, someone deeply engaged in asking hard questions that take a lifetime to resolve.”</description>

  <description>When a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality - and brutal savagery - of their situation sets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boys' struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be. Often compared to &lt;i&gt;Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/i&gt; also represents a coming-of-age story of innocence lost.</description>

      <![CDATA[Một câu chuyện đẹp và tràn đầy đam mê về nước Ý của nhà báo Trương Anh Ngọc...<br />Vài lần được nghe anh Ngọc bình luận bóng đá và thấy thích phong cách bình luận dí dỏm của anh. Đó là lý do chính tôi mua cuốn sách này của anh về đọc. Và tôi nghĩ qua cuốn truyện này, anh Ngọc đã làm được việc mang đến một cái nhìn mới về nước Ý cho người đọc, rất có chiều sâu và nhiều gam màu sắc. Dù có yêu nước Ý hay không, phải công nhận là nước Ý thật đặc biệt. Và có thể hiểu Anh Ngọc đã thấm tâm hồn người Ý như thế nào. <br />]]>

  <description>Another rediscovered masterpiece from the Hungarian novelist whose Embers""became an international bestseller--a sensuous, suspenseful, aphoristic novel about the world's most notorious seducer and the encounter that changes him forever. In 1756 Giacomo Casanova escapes from a Venetian prison and resurfaces in the Italian village of Bolzano. Here he receives an unwelcome visitor: the aging but still fearsome Duke of Parma, who years before had defeated Casanova in a duel over a ravishing girl named Francesca and spared his life on condition that he never see her again. Now the duke has taken Francesca as his wife--and intercepted a love letter from her to his old rival. Rather than kill Casanova on the spot, he makes him a startling offer, one that is logical, perverse, and irresistible. Turning an historical episode into a dazzling fictional exploration of the clasp of desire and death, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that Sandor Marai is one of the most distinctive voices of the twentieth century.</description>

  <description>The inside story of Facebook, told with the full, exclusive cooperation of founder Mark Zuckerberg and the company's other leaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In little more than half a decade,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Facebook has gone from a dorm-room novelty to a company with 500 million users. It is one of the fastest growing companies in history, an essential part of the social life not only of teenagers but hundreds of millions of adults worldwide. As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects—even becoming instrumental in political protests from Colombia to Iran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook’s key executives in researching this fascinating history of the company and its impact on our lives. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company’s remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; How did a nineteen-year-old Harvard student create a company that has transformed the Internet and how did he grow it to its current enormous size? Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg steadfastly refused to compromise his vision, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, altering politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity. This is the Facebook Effect.</description>

  <description>"In this classic of the 1960s, Ken Kesey's hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, a boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who swaggers into the world of a mental hospital and takes over. A lusty, life-affirming fighter, McMurphy rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched. He promotes gambling in the ward, smuggles in wine and women, and openly defies the rules at every turn. But this defiance, which starts as a sport, soon develops into a grim struggle, an all-out war between two relentless opponents: Nurse Ratched, back by the full power of authority, and McMurphy, who has only his own indomitable will. What happens when Nurse Ratched uses her ultimate weapon against McMurphy provides the story's shocking climax.</description>

  <description>New York City. Two in the morning. A subway car heading uptown. Jack Reacher, plus five other passengers. Four are okay. The fifth isn’t.&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;In the next few tense seconds Reacher will make a choice–and trigger an electrifying chain of events in this gritty, gripping masterwork of suspense by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Lee Child.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Susan Mark was the fifth passenger. She had a lonely heart, an estranged son, and a big secret. Reacher, working with a woman cop and a host of shadowy feds, wants to know just how big a hole Susan Mark was in, how many lives had already been twisted before hers, and what danger is looming around him now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because a race has begun through the streets of Manhattan in a maze crowded with violent, skilled soldiers on all sides of a shadow war. Susan Mark’s plain little life was critical to dozens of others in Washington, California, Afghanistan . . . from a former Delta Force operator now running for the U.S. Senate, to a beautiful young woman with a fantastic story to tell–and to a host of others who have just one thing in common: They’re all lying to Reacher. A little. A lot. Or maybe just enough to get him killed.&lt;p&gt;In a novel that slams through one hairpin surprise after another, Lee Child unleashes a thriller that spans three decades and gnaws at the heart of America . . . and for Jack Reacher, a man who trusts no one and likes it that way, it’s a mystery with only one answer–the kind that comes when you finally get face-to-face and look your worst enemy in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;Winning will make you famous. &lt;br /&gt;Losing means certain death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.</description>

      <![CDATA[Đọc truyện này vì mê bài Safe and Sound của Taylor Swift quá (bài soundtrack của phim The Hunger Games sắp tới). Nội dung thì khá OK, nhưng mình không ấn tượng lắm vì cách kể chuyện lắm. Cảm giác thiếu chiều sâu thế nào đó. Một số chi tiết đi qua quá nhanh, gây hụt hẫng, ví dụ cụ thể như khi Thresh để Katniss đi rồi cướp đồ của Cato, nhưng sau đó chết dưới tay Cato chỉ được miêu tả qua tiếng báo hiệu của ban tổ chức T_T. <br />Loạt truyện còn 2 phần nữa, không biết có nên xem nữa không. ]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;What are our obligations to others as people in a free society? Should government tax the rich to help the poor? Is the free market fair? Is it sometimes wrong to tell the truth? Is killing sometimes morally required? Is it possible, or desirable, to legislate morality? Do individual rights and the common good conflict? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael J. Sandel’s “Justice” course is one of the most popular and influential at Harvard. Up to a thousand students pack the campus theater to hear Sandel relate the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of the day, and this fall, public television will air a series based on the course. &lt;i&gt;Justice &lt;/i&gt;offers readers the same exhilarating journey that captivates Harvard students. This book is a searching, lyrical exploration of the meaning of justice, one that invites readers of all political persuasions to consider familiar controversies in fresh and illuminating ways. Affirmative action, same-sex marriage, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, national service, patriotism and dissent, the moral limits of markets—Sandel dramatizes the challenge of thinking through these conflicts, and shows how a surer grasp of philosophy can help us make sense of politics, morality, and our own convictions as well. &lt;i&gt;Justice &lt;/i&gt;is lively, thought-provoking, and wise—an essential new addition to the small shelf of books that speak convincingly to the hard questions of our civic life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Một quyển sách quá hay. Đâu là công lý, đâu là việc đúng nên làm, nhiều khi có những điều mà ta thấy đó là điều hiển nhiên, thế mà thực chất tất cả đều có những căn cơ của nó. Cuốn sách đã trình bày, khơi gợi lên những vấn đề gai góc gây nhiều tranh cãi nhất của thời đại này: nhập ngũ, đẻ thuê, ưu tiên thiểu số khi tuyển sinh, vấn đề nhập cư... <br /><br />"Trong suốt hành trình này, chúng ta đã khám phá ba cách tiếp cận công lý. Cách thứ nhất nói công lý nghĩa là tăng tối đa tiện ích hay phúc lợi - hạnh phúc lớn nhất cho nhiều người nhất. Cách thứ hai cho rằng công lý là tôn trọng quyền tự do lựa chọn, cho dù lựa chọn thực sự đưa ra trong một thị trường tự do cá nhân (quan điểm của chủ nghĩa tự do cá nhân) hoặc lựa chọn giả thuyết mọi người đưa ra trong tình trạng bình đẳng ban đầu (quan điểm chủ nghĩa tự do dân chủ quân bình). Cách thứ ba nói công lý liên quan đến việc trau dồi đức tính và lý luận về lợi ích chung..."<br /><br />Highly suggestion :) ]]>

      <![CDATA[Vẫn như Lấp lánh, cảm giác truyện của bà này cứ nhẹ nhàng trôi đi quá, không để lại quá nhiều ấn tượng. Nhưng cũng đồng cảm với một số nhân vật trong truyện :D <br />Nói chung là truyện OK. Với cả, sau khi đọc một tác phẩm nặng nề như 1Q84 thì đây coi như là một khoảng thời gian để relax. ]]>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s — &lt;i&gt;1Q84&lt;/i&gt; is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.</description>

  <description>Berlin, 1942 : When Bruno returns home from school one day, he discovers that his belongings are being packed in crates. His father has received a promotion and the family must move to a new house far, far away, where there is no one to play with and nothing to do. A tall fence stretches as far as the eye can see and cuts him off from the strange people in the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Bruno longs to be an explorer and decides that there must be more to this desolate new place than meets the eye. While exploring his new environment, he meets another boy whose life and circumstances are very different from his own, and their meeting results in a friendship that has devastating consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler&lt;/i&gt; is a marvel of ingenuity, an experimental text that looks longingly back to the great age of narration--"when time no longer seemed stopped and did not yet seem to have exploded." Italo Calvino's novel is in one sense a comedy in which the two protagonists, the Reader and the Other Reader, ultimately end up married, having almost finished &lt;i&gt;If on a Winter's Night a Traveler.&lt;/i&gt; In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: "Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade." Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next. &lt;p&gt; The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches--stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition--with explorations of how and why we read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. &lt;i&gt;If on a Winter's Night&lt;/i&gt; is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. "What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.</description>

  <description>This work has become a benchmark of popular anthropology and psychology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoologist Desmond Morris considers humans as being simply another animal species in this classic book first published in 1967. Here is the Naked Ape at his most primal in love, at work, at war. Meet man as he really is: relative to the apes, stripped of his veneer as we see him courting, making love, sleeping, socializing, grooming, playing. &lt;b&gt;The Naked Ape&lt;/b&gt; takes its place alongside Darwin’s &lt;b&gt;Origin of the Species&lt;/b&gt;, presenting man not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape, remarkable in his resilience, energy and imagination, yet an animal nonetheless, in danger of forgetting his origins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its penetrating insights on mans beginnings, sex life, habits and our astonishing bonds to the animal kingdom, &lt;b&gt;The Naked Ape&lt;/b&gt; is a landmark, at once provocative, compelling and timeless.</description>

  <description>"All animals are equal. But some animals are more equal than others."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night on an English farm, Major the boar recounts his vision of a utopia where his fellow creatures own the land along with the means of production and are no longer the slaves of humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before long his dream comes true, and for a short while all animals really are equal. But the clever pigs educate themselves and soon learn how to extend their own power, inevitably at the expense of the rest of the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This well-loved tale is, of course, a satire on the Soviet Communist system that still remains a powerful warning despite the changes in world politics since "Animal Farm" was first published.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This production is based on Orwell's own radio version which was first produced in 1947.</description>

      <![CDATA[Đây là tác phẩm thứ hai của George Orwell mà tôi đọc, sau 1984 của ông. Vẫn cảm thấy rất khâm phục khả năng sáng tạo của tác giả, và cố gắng viết vài dòng review về tác phẩm này khi cảm xúc còn mới. <br /><br />Truyện viết về một cuộc khởi nghĩa tưởng tượng của súc vật trong một trang trại nọ, vùng lên giành "chính quyền" từ tay chủ trại, để lập ra một "trật tự xã hội" khác, cái mà có thể tóm gọn trong tuyên ngôn mà bọn cừu tụng ngày đêm: "Bốn chân là tốt, hai chân là xấu". Sau cuộc khởi nghĩa, đã có lúc xã hội mới ấy phát triển tốt, khi mọi con vật đều hăng say làm việc vì tự do, cho chính bản thân chúng chư không phải cho "bọn người tham lam". Nhưng rồi khi một con lợn gọi là Napoleon lên làm thủ lĩnh, xã hội ấy dần dần phát triển trở lại với hình thức độc tài cai trị. Cái khác ở đây không phải là người nữa, mà là một con lợn. Mà cũng không còn khác nữa, khi hình ảnh cuối tác phẩm là bữa tiệc giữa người và lợn, không thể phân biệt nổi giữa hai hình ảnh ấy. <br /><br />Truyện có rất nhiều nhân vật ấn tượng. Con ngựa Chiến sĩ đáng thương chỉ biết chăm chỉ làm việc nhưng ngu đần (không thuộc được quá chữ D của bảng chữ cái), chỉ có câu cửa miệng là "Tôi sẽ cố gắng hơn nữa". Để rồi kết cục cho những sự cống hiến hết mình ấy chỉ là cái chết thê thảm cho kẻ độc tài. Con lợn Chỉ Điểm rất giỏi khoản mị dân, khi liên tục hỏi "đồng chí có chắc chắn nhớ như thế không?" (khổ thân bọn súc vật trí nhớ ngắn tèo). Con lừa Benjamin thông thái, chỉ lặng lẽ, dửng dưng trước mọi thay đổi thế cuộc, luôn mồm nói "lừa sống dai lắm". Và còn nhiều nhiều nhân vật nữa. Tác giả miêu tả bọn súc vật khá ngây ngô và đáng thương, nhưng qua đó thấy hình ảnh đại diện cho đủ mọi tầng lớp trong xã hội loài người. <br /><br />Đọc truyện này sau khi đọc 1984, thấy rất nhiều ý tưởng tương đồng giữa hai tác phẩm. Bảy điều răn của xã hội súc vật liên tục bị kẻ thống trị thay đổi ("Đồng chí Napoleon luôn đúng" - phương châm của Chiến Sĩ) chẳng khác gì sự thay đổi, kiểm duyệt tài liệu liên tục của Đảng cho phù hợp với ý muốn của Bác. Lúc thì đánh nhau với Trại Cáo, nhưng lúc sau lại quay ngoắt bảo đánh nhau với Trại Keo, không sao, vì Napoleon luôn đúng. Cũng như lúc thì đánh nhau với Đông Á, lúc thì đánh nhau Âu Á mới là kẻ thù, vì Bác muốn thế. Mọi hình thức chống đối đều bị đàn áp dã man, với Trại Súc Vật là bầy chó thi hành, với 1984 thì người thực hiện là Cảnh sát Ngầm. Những con vật đáng thương chịu khổ vì ngu dốt, không có nổi ý thức đấu tranh, không khác gì Dân đen dưới sự thống trị của Đảng. Con lợn Chỉ Điểm liên tục đưa ra dữ liệu cho thấy xã hội chỉ tốt đẹp lên từ ngày khởi nghĩa, trong khi các con vật luôn đói ăn. Đảng thì luôn lải nhải phát thanh mị dân, đưa ra số liệu cho thấy năm nào cũng phát triển, cho dù người dân thì nghèo khổ đến đâu. Lũ gia súc trí thông minh có hạn, không thể trách được, vì đến người cũng còn tin thế cơ mà. Còn nhiều nhiều sự tương đồng nữa tôi phát hiện khi đọc Trại Súc Vật. <br /><br />Truyện có nhiều điểm tương đồng như vậy nên sẽ kém hay hơn so với truyện 1984 (bắt bài mà:D). Nhưng mà vẫn thích cách thể hiện của tác giả. Cho nên cho 4 sao :D<br />]]>

  <description>Dans une ville d'eaux au charme suranné, huit personnages s'étreignent au gré d'une valse qui va s'accélérant : une jolie infirmière ; un gynécologue fantaisiste ; un richard américain (à la fois saint et don Juan) ; un trompettiste célèbre ; un ancien détenu, victime des purges et sur le point de quitter son pays... &lt;br /&gt;Un «songe d'une nuit d'été». &lt;br /&gt;Un «vaudeville noir». &lt;br /&gt;Les questions les plus graves y sont posées avec une blasphématoire légèreté qui nous fait comprendre que le monde moderne nous a privés même du droit au tragique.</description>

  <description>The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell's prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. &lt;i&gt;1984&lt;/i&gt; is still the great modern classic of "negative utopia" -a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel's hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions -a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch—and there's always a catch—is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Kafka on the Shore&lt;/i&gt; is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As their paths converge, and the reasons for that convergence become clear, Haruki Murakami enfolds readers in a world where cats talk, fish fall from the sky, and spirits slip out of their bodies to make love or commit murder. &lt;i&gt;Kafka on the Shore&lt;/i&gt; displays one of the world’s great storytellers at the peak of his powers.</description>

  <description>A searing, post apocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.</description>

  <description>Gone with the Wind is a novel written by Margaret Mitchell, first published in 1936. The story is set in Clayton County, Georgia, and Atlanta during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of the poverty she finds herself in after Sherman's March to the Sea. A historical novel, the story is a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone with the Wind was popular with American readers from the onset and was the top American fiction bestseller in the year it was published and in 1937. As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible. More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide.</description>

  <description>When The Fountainhead was first published, Ayn Rand''s daringly original literary vision and her groundbreaking philosophy, Objectivism, won immediate worldwide interest and acclaim. This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who struggles to defeat him. This edition contains a special afterword by Rand's literary executor, Leonard Peikoff, which includes excerpts from Ayn Rand's own notes on the making of The Fountainhead. As fresh today as it was then, here is a novel about a hero-and about those who try to destroy him.</description>

His sole companion was Shimamoto, also an only child. Together they spent long afternoons listening to her father's record collection. But when his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar. Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all he has in the present.</description>

  <description>Khaled Hosseini's #1 New York Times Bestselling Debut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt; “It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amir is the son of a wealthy Kabul merchant, a member of the ruling caste of Pashtuns. Hassan, his servant and constant companion, is a Hazara, a despised and impoverished caste. Their uncommon bond is torn by Amir's choice to abandon his friend amidst the increasing ethnic, religious, and political tensions of the dying years of the Afghan monarchy, wrenching them far apart. But so strong is the bond between the two boys that Amir journeys back to a distant world, to try to right past wrongs against the only true friend he ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his father’s servant, &lt;i&gt;The Kite Runner&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption; and an exploration of the power of fathers over sons—their love, their sacrifices, their lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years, &lt;i&gt;The Kite Runner&lt;/i&gt; is an unusual and powerful novel that has become a beloved, one-of-a-kind classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/b&gt; is Barack Obama's call for a new kind of politics—a politics that builds upon those shared understandings that pull us together as Americans. Lucid in his vision of America's place in the world, refreshingly candid about his family life and his time in the Senate, Obama here sets out his political convictions and inspires us to trust in the dogged optimism that has long defined us and that is our best hope going forward.</description>

  <description>No woman could resist him—except the one he wanted most...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cool, Calm, Collected...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fazes Taylor Donovan. In the courtroom she never lets the opposition see her sweat. In her personal life, she never lets any man rattle her—not even her cheating ex-fiancé. So when she's assigned to coach People's "Sexiest Man Alive" for his role in his next big legal thriller, she refuses to fall for the Hollywood heartthrob's charms. Even if he is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Jason Andrews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confident, Famous, Irresistible...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Andrews is used to having women fall at his feet. When Taylor Donovan gives him the cold shoulder, he's thrown for a loop. She's unlike any other woman he's ever met: uninterested in the limelight, seemingly immune to his advances, and shockingly capable of saying no to him. She's the perfect challenge. And the more she rejects him, the more he begins to realize she may just be his perfect match.</description>

  <description>Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. And he detests the color yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, a neighbor's dog, Wellington, is killed and his carefully constructive universe is threatened. Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely literally.</description>

  <description>The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it, To Kill A Mockingbird became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.</description>

  <description>1918 Ernest Hemingway went to war, to the 'war to end all wars'. He volunteered for ambulance service in Italy, was wounded and twice decorated. Out of his experiences came A Farewell to Arms. Hemingway's description of war is unforgettable. He recreates the fear, the comradeship, the courage of his young American volunteer and the men and women he meets in Italy with total conviction. But A Farewell to Arms is not only a novel of war. In it Hemingway has also created a love story of immense drama and uncompromising passion.</description>

  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <description>Tolstoy's epic masterpiece intertwines the lives of private and public individuals during the time of the Napoleonic wars and the French invasion of Russia. The fortunes of the Rostovs and the Bolkonskys, of Pierre, Natasha, and Andrei, are intimately connected with the national history that is played out in parallel with their lives. Balls and soirees alternate with councils of war and the machinations of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles with everyday human passions in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prodigious cast of characters, seem to act and move as if connected by threads of destiny as the novel relentlessly questions ideas of free will, fate, and providence. Yet Tolstoy's portrayal of marital relations and scenes of domesticity is as truthful and poignant as the grand themes that underlie them.</description>

  <description>Ryu Murakami, along with Haruki Murakami (no relation), is one of the best-selling writers in Japan and a major figure in contemporary popular culture. Since publishing his first work, Almost Transparent Blue, which won Japan's most coveted literary prize in 1976, Ryu has produced a steady stream of novels, stories, and essays that consistently astound and delight readers with their wild flights of imagination, irreverent humor, and brilliant, convincing portraits of some of the quirkiest characters in Japanese literature. &lt;p&gt;69 is a roman a clef about coming of age during a time that left its mark on baby boomers around the world--a time when we really believed we could change the world before it changed us. By turns hilarious, cynical, frivolous, and poignant, the book is infused from start to finish with Ryu's relentless energy and optimism; it simply refuses to get tedious, preachy, or "literary" for a single moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is composed of the following: "Arthur Rimbaud," "Iron Butterfly," "Lady Jane," "Daniel Cohn-Bendit," "Claudia Cardinale," "Power to the Imagination," "Just Like a Woman," "Alain Delon," "Lyndon Johnson," "Cheap Thrills," "Amore Romantico," "Wes Montgomery," "Led Zeppelin," "April Come She Will," "Velvet Underground," and "It's a Beautiful Day."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Born a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them—in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul—they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Alternate cover edition &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26845522-underground"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of the perpetrators' intentions, the Tokyo gas attack left only twelve people dead, but thousands were injured and many suffered serious after-effects. Murakami interviews the victims to try and establish precisely what happened on the subway that day. He also interviews members and ex-members of the doomsdays cult responsible, in the hope that they might be able to explain the reason for the attack and how it was that their guru instilled such devotion in his followers.</description>

  <description>When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol—seared into the chest of a murdered physicist—he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati ... the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy—the Catholic Church. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Langdon’s worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair ... a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation.</description>

  <description>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone, or something, starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects: Harry Potter himself?</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;How to Read a Book,&lt;/i&gt; originally published in 1940, has become a rare phenomenon, a &lt;i&gt;living&lt;/i&gt; classic. It is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader. And now it has been completely rewritten and updated. &lt;p&gt; You are told about the various levels of reading and how to achieve them – from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading, you learn how to pigeonhole a book, X-ray it, extract the author's message, criticize. You are taught the different reading techniques for reading practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests whereby you can measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;WHAT IS LOST...&lt;br /&gt;WILL BE FOUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this stunning follow-up to the global phenomenon &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;, Dan Brown demonstrates once again why he is the world's mos popular thriller writer. &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt; is a masterstroke of storytelling - a deadly race through a real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and unseen truths...all under the watchful eye of Brown's most terrifying villain to date. Set within the hidden chambers, tunnels, and temples of Washington, DC., &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt; accelerates through a startling landscape toward an unthinkable finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the story opens, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned unexpectedly to deliver an evening lecture in the U.S. Capitol Building. Within minutes of his arrival, however, the night takes a bizarre turn. A disturbing object - artfully encoded with five symbols - is discovered in the Capitol Building. Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient invitation...one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Langdon's beloved mentor, Peter Solomon - a prominent Mason and philanthropist - is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations - all of which seem to be dragging hi toward a single, inconceivable truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the world discovered in &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/i&gt;, Dan Brown's novels are brilliant tapestries of veiled histries, arcane symbols, and enigmatic codes. In this new novel, he again challenges readers with an intelligent, lightning-paced story that offers surprises at every turn. &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt; is exactly what Brown's fans have been waiting for...his most thrilling novel yet.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;It is often spur-of-the-moment decisions, sometimes made by others, that can change our whole lives.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestselling author Jeffrey Archer returns with a powerful tale of twins separated by fate and reunited by destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1940's in Hartford, Connecticut a set of twins is parted at birth. Nat Cartwright goes home with his parents, a schoolteacher and an insurance salesman. But his twin brother is to begin his days as Fletcher Andrew Davenport, the only son of a multi-millionaire and his society wife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the years that follow, the two brothers grow up unaware of each other's existence. Nat leaves college at the University of Connecticut to serve in Vietnam. He returns a war hero, finishes school and becomes a successful banker. Fletcher, meanwhile, has graduated from Yale University and distinguishes himself as a criminal defense lawyer before he is elected to the Senate. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when Nat and Fletcher fall in love with the same girl they still don't meet. They continue on their separate paths until one has to defend the other for a murder he did not commit. But the final confrontation comes when Nat and Fletcher are selected to stand against each other for governor of the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the tradition of Jeffrey Archer's most popular books, &lt;i&gt;Sons of Fortune&lt;/i&gt; is as much a chronicle of a nation in transition as it is the story of two remarkable men and how, eventually, they come to discover the truth - and its extraordinary consequences...</description>

  <description>"... Tôi đang trôi gần đến cái chết, đang lênh đênh trên dòng nước chảy xuống triền núi. Một chút nữa, nơi mặt đất dừng lại, dòng nước sẽ rơi xuống vực và bên dưới là thung lũng nằm trọng bóng tối mênh mông. Tôi đang trôi và đang mất đi, đang trôi mãi về nơi mặt đất sẽ dừng lại..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trên đây là một trích đoạn trong Và khi tro bụi của Đoàn Minh Phượng.</description>

  <description>All students and professors need to write, and many struggle to finish their stalled dissertations, journal articles, book chapters, or grant proposals. Writing is hard work and can be difficult to wedge into a frenetic academic schedule. In this practical, light-hearted, and encouraging book, Paul J. Silvia explains that writing productively does not require innate skills or special traits but specific tactics and actions. Drawing examples from his own field of psychology, he shows readers how to overcome motivational roadblocks and become prolific without sacrificing evenings, weekends, and vacations. After describing strategies for writing productively, the author gives detailed advice from the trenches on how to write, submit, revise, and resubmit articles; how to improve writing quality; and how to write and publish academic work.</description>

  <description>Here is the autobiography of a remarkable man. Yukichi Fukuzawa's life covered the 66 years between 1835 and 1901, a period which comprised greater and more extraordinary changes than any other in the history of Japan. In his country's swift transformation from an isolated feudal state to a full-fledged member of the modern world, Fukuzawa played a leading role: he was the educator of the new Japan, the man who above all others explained to his countrymen the ideas behind the dazzling material evidence of Western civilization. Dictated by Fukuzawa in 1897, this book vividly relates his story, from his childhood as a member of the lower samurai class in a small, caste-bound village. His escape from the hopeless destiny decreed by his social position, his adventures as a student of Dutch (the language of the only Westerners allowed in Japan), his travels aboard the first Japanese ship to sail to America -- all prepared Fukuzawa to write Seiyo Jijo (Things Western), the book which made him famous. His special perspective on Japan's tempestuous 19th century gives Fukuzawa's life story added fascination.</description>

  <description>Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/i&gt; is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life...as only a dog could tell it.</description>

  <description>Wuthering Heights is a wild, passionate story of the intense and almost demonic love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. After Mr Earnshaw's death, Heathcliff is bullied and humiliated by Catherine's brother Hindley and wrongly believing that his love for Catherine is not reciprocated, leaves Wuthering Heights, only to return years later as a wealthy and polished man. He proceeds to exact a terrible revenge for his former miseries. The action of the story is chaotic and unremittingly violent, but the accomplished handling of a complex structure, the evocative descriptions of the lonely moorland setting and the poetic grandeur of vision combine to make this unique novel a masterpiece of English literature.</description>

  <description>At once provocative and laugh-out-loud funny, &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt; ignited a global parenting debate with its story of one mother’s journey in strict parenting. Amy Chua argues that Western parenting tries to respect and nurture children’s individuality, while Chinese parents typically believe that arming children with skills, strong work habits, and inner confidence prepares them best for the future. &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Chua’s iron-willed decision to raise her daughters, Sophia and Lulu, the Chinese way--and the remarkable, sometimes heartbreaking results her choice inspires. Achingly honest and profoundly challenging, &lt;i&gt;Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most talked-about books of our times.</description>

  <description>Banana Yoshimoto's novels have made her a sensation in Japan and all over the world, and &lt;i&gt;Kitchen&lt;/i&gt;, the dazzling English-language debut that is still her best-loved book, is an enchantingly original and deeply affecting book about mothers, love, tragedy, and the power of the kitchen and home in the lives of a pair of free-spirited young women in contemporary Japan. Mikage, the heroine of &lt;i&gt;Kitchen&lt;/i&gt;, is an orphan raised by her grandmother, who has passed away. Grieving, she is taken in by her friend Yoichi and his mother (who was once his father), Eriko. As the three of them form an improvised family that soon weathers its own tragic losses, Yoshimoto spins a lovely, evocative tale that recalls early Marguerite Duras. &lt;i&gt;Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; and its companion story, "Moonlight Shadow," are elegant tales whose seeming simplicity is the ruse of a writer whose voice echoes in the mind and the soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt; met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001). Unforgettable!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

  <description>The young Austrian writer Daniel Kehlmann conjures a brilliant and gently comic novel from the lives of two geniuses of the Enlightenment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toward the end of the eighteenth century, two young Germans set out to measure the world. One of them, the Prussian aristocrat Alexander von Humboldt, negotiates savanna and jungle, travels down the Orinoco, tastes poisons, climbs the highest mountain known to man, counts head lice, and explores every hole in the ground. The other, the barely socialized mathematician and astronomer Carl Friedrich Gauss, does not even need to leave his home in Göttingen to prove that space is curved. He can run prime numbers in his head. He cannot imagine a life without women, yet he jumps out of bed on his wedding night to jot down a mathematical formula. Von Humboldt is known to history as the Second Columbus. Gauss is recognized as the greatest mathematical brain since Newton. Terrifyingly famous and more than eccentric in their old age, the two meet in Berlin in 1828. Gauss has hardly climbed out of his carriage before both men are embroiled in the political turmoil sweeping through Germany after Napoleon’s fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already a huge best seller in Germany, &lt;i&gt;Measuring the World&lt;/i&gt; marks the debut of a glorious new talent on the international scene.</description>

  <description>A short, sleek novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn, and every bit as gripping as Haruki Murakami’s masterworks &lt;i&gt;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kafka on the Shore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its center are two sisters—Eri, a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion, and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny’s toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims they’ve met before, a burly female “love hotel” manager and her maid staff, and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These “night people” are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Eri’s slumber—mysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime—will either restore or annihilate her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Dark &lt;/i&gt;moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency—the interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. Murakami’s trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter is midway through both his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about Cho Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream). He wants to find out about the mysterious event that supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for hundreds of years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards.&lt;br /&gt;And in his case, different can be deadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-From the back cover</description>

  <description>They got married ten days ago. They haven't had sex yet and they don't intend to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out, the only way to make their parents get off their backs about trying to "find someone" was actually finding someone--with whom to put marriage for show. Mutsuki is strictly gay and has a boyfriend, while Shoko is a clinical case of emotional instability who's in no shape for a relationship. They've each found in the other a perfect partner for a sham marriage. Since the conspirators' parents know of their own child's undesirability, but not the spouse's, the union manages to please them. And while the newlyweds hope, in their own way, to live happily ever after, they inevitably come face to face with the fact that no marriage real or staged, is a fairy tale.</description>

      <![CDATA[Lấp lánh <br />Ekuni Kaori - Phạm Quỳnh Nga dịch - <br /><br />Chọn quyển sách này về đọc vì đó là tác phẩm cô giáo mình dịch, phần nữa là vì đọc thấy nhận xét tác giả Ekuni Kaori như một "Haruki Murakami nữ " của văn học Nhật Bản. Nhưng tác phẩm này chỉ nhẹ nhàng đi qua, mình thực sự ít cảm nhận được cái hay của nó. Đã mua cả "Tháp Tokyo" của cùng tác giả, không biết có hay không nữa :| <br />Được cái đọc những tác phẩm của các tác giả Nhật Bản thấy thật gần gũi. Thấy nhớ Nhật Bản quá :( ]]>

  <description>The hero-narrator of &lt;i&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/i&gt; is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.</description>

  <description>This new edition of &lt;i&gt;The World Is Flat&lt;/i&gt; is Friedman's account of the great changes taking place in our time, as lightning-swift advances in technology &amp;amp; communications put people all over the globe in touch as never before--creating an explosion of wealth in India &amp;amp; China, &amp;amp; challenging the rest to run even faster just to stay in place. This updated &amp;amp; expanded edition features over a 100 pages of new reporting &amp;amp; commentary, drawn from Friedman's travels round the world &amp;amp; across the American heartland--from anyplace where the flattening of the world is being felt. &lt;i&gt;The World Is Flat&lt;/i&gt; shows "how &amp;amp; why globalization has now shifted into warp drive" (Robert Wright, Slate) &amp;amp; demystifies the new flat world for readers, allowing them to make sense of the often bewildering scene unfolding before their eyes. With his ability to translate complex foreign policy &amp;amp; economic issues, he explains how the flattening of the world happened at the dawn of the 21st century; what it means to countries, companies, communities &amp;amp; individuals; how governments &amp;amp; societies must adapt &amp;amp; why terrorists want to stand in the way. &lt;i&gt;The World Is Flat&lt;/i&gt; is an essential update on globalization, its successes &amp;amp; discontents, powerfully illuminated by a respected journalist.</description>

  <description>An ingenious code hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. A desperate race through the cathedrals and castles of Europe. An astonishing truth concealed for centuries . . . unveiled at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.</description>

Những bức tranh kỳ l,ạ của cô gái chủ gallery đã làm anh choáng váng. Anh không sao rời mắt khỏi những bức tranh đó. Từ bức tranh com mèo được vẽ hệt như con mèo của anh, rồi những bức tranh thiếu nữ trên tường...tất cả đều mang lại cho anh một cảm giác ngột ngạt khó thở...nó khiến anh liên tưởng đến Thái Vân của Anh. Anh không sao có thể rứt khỏi cảm giác ấy...Chỉ còn một chiều nữa thuôi là anh phải rời nơi đây, quay lại phòng tranh để mua tranh con mèo, và cũng chính con mèo ở gallery ấy đã giúp anh tìm được người chủ phòng tranh - Thái Vân, người con gái mà anh hằng yêu dấu. &lt;br /&gt;Câu chuyện được kết thức bằng tiếng hát nhẹ nhàng như gió của Thái Vân: " Em vẫn nghĩ rằng lấy chống phải lấy người như anh. Hoa trên mặt đất nở vì ai, uyên ương dưới nước thành đôi vì ai".</description>

  <description>At once a fiendishly devious mystery, a beguiling love story, and a brilliant symposium on the power of art, &lt;i&gt;My Name Is Red&lt;/i&gt; is a transporting tale set amid the splendor and religious intrigue of sixteenth-century Istanbul, from one of the most prominent contemporary Turkish writers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Part fantasy and part philosophical puzzle, &lt;i&gt;My Name is Red&lt;/i&gt; is a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.</description>

  <description>Orphaned into the household of her Aunt Reed at Gateshead and subject to the cruel regime at Lowood charity school, Jane Eyre nonetheless emerges unbroken in spirit and integrity. She takes up the post of governess at Thornfield, falls in love with Mr. Rochester, and discovers the impediment to their lawful marriage in a story that transcends melodrama to portray a woman's passionate search for a wider and richer life than Victorian society traditionally allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a heroine full of yearning, the dangerous secrets she encounters, and the choices she finally makes, Charlotte Bronte's innovative and enduring romantic novel continues to engage and provoke readers.</description>

  <description>It's no longer safe for Harry at Hogwarts, so he and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, are on the run. Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.</description>

  <description>Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before. Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable. As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, &lt;b&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/b&gt; takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.</description>

  <description>A more contemporary story would be impossible: the Internet, pagers, airline e-tickets, genome decoding, text messages. And it's a classic love story. A story of love on the Internet. The ultimate love, the one of dreams. &lt;br /&gt;Wisniewski tells the story superbly and analytically taking his reader from near celebratory tenderness only to amaze a few lines later with daring eroticism. Loneliness on the Net is also a tribute to knowledge intertwined with a love story. It's a story about molecules of emotions, about who discovered DNA, and what happened to Einstein's brain. &lt;br /&gt;Loneliness on the Net hit all bestseller lists in Poland (over 300 000 copies sold). The novel has been translated into many languages and was brought to the Polish cinema theatres as a feature movie in 2006.</description>

  <description>Welcome to our genetic world.&lt;p&gt;Fast, furious, and out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the world of the future --- it's the world right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is a loved one missing some body parts? Are blondes becoming extinct? Is everyone at your dinner table of the same species? Humans and chimpanzees differ in only 400 genes; is that why an adult human being resembles a chimp fetus? And should that worry us? There's a new genetic cure for drug addiction --- is it worse than the disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in a time of momentous scientific leaps; a time when it's possible to sell our eggs and sperm online for thousands of dollars; test our spouses for genetic maladies and even frame someone for a genetic crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We live in a time when one fifth of all our genes are owned by someone else, and an unsuspecting person and his family can be pursued cross-country because they happen to have certain valuable genes within their chromosomes ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devilishly clever, Next blends fact and fiction into a breathless tale of a new world where nothing is what it seems, and a set of new possibilities can open at every turn. Next challenges our sense of reality and notions of morality. Balancing the comic and bizarre with the genuinely frightening and disturbing, Next shatters our assumptions, and reveals shocking new choices where we least expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future is closer than you think. Get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This epic work of the imagination has captured the hearts of millions of readers worldwide since it was first published more than a decade ago. Its special story within a story is an irresistible invitation for readers to become part of the book itself. And now this modern classic and bibliophile's dream is available in hardcover again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story begins with a lonely boy named Bastian and the strange book that draws him into the beautiful but doomed world of Fantastica. Only a human can save this enchanted place--by giving its ruler, the Childlike Empress, a new name. But the journey to her tower leads through lands of dragons, giants, monsters, and magic--and once Bastian begins his quest, he may never return. As he is drawn deeper into Fantastica, he must find the courage to face unspeakable foes and the mysteries of his own heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers, too, can travel to the wondrous, unforgettable world of Fantastica if they will just turn the page....</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;An epic Chinese tale in the vein of &lt;i&gt;The Last Emperor&lt;/i&gt;, Wolf Totem depicts the dying culture of the Mongols-the ancestors of the Mongol hordes who at one time terrorized the world-and the parallel extinction of the animal they believe to be sacred: the fierce and otherworldly Mongolian wolf&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Published under a pen name, &lt;i&gt;Wolf Totem&lt;/i&gt; was a phenomenon in China, breaking all sales records there and earning the distinction of being the second most read book after Mao's little red book. There has been much international excitement too-to date, rights have been sold in thirteen countries. Wolf Totem is set in 1960s China-the time of the Great Leap Forward, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Searching for spirituality, Beijing intellectual Chen Zhen travels to the pristine grasslands of Inner Mongolia to live among the nomadic Mongols-a proud, brave, and ancient race of people who coexist in perfect harmony with their unspeakably beautiful but cruel natural surroundings. Their philosophy of maintaining a balance with nature is the ground stone of their religion, a kind of cult of the wolf. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The fierce wolves that haunt the steppes of the unforgiving grassland searching for food are locked with the nomads in a profoundly spiritual battle for survival-a life-and-death dance that has gone on between them for thousands of years. The Mongols believe that the wolf is a great and worthy foe that they are divinely instructed to contend with, but also to worship and to learn from. Chen's own encounters with the otherworldly wolves awake a latent primitive instinct in him, and his fascination with them blossoms into obsession, then reverence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After many years, the peace is shattered with the arrival of Chen's kinfolk, Han Chinese, sent from the cities to bring modernity to the grasslands. They immediately launch a campaign to exterminate the wolves, sending the balance that has been maintained with religious dedication for thousands of years into a spiral leading to extinction-first the wolves, then the Mongol culture, finally the land. As a result of the eradication of the wolves, rats become a plague and wild sheep graze until the meadows turn to dust. Mongolian dust storms glide over Beijing, sometimes blocking out the moon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Part period epic, part fable for modern days, &lt;i&gt;Wolf Totem&lt;/i&gt; is a stinging social commentary on the dangers of China's overaccelerated economic growth as well as a fascinating immersion into the heart of Chinese culture.</description>

  <description>In &lt;i&gt;The Lexus and the Olive Tree&lt;/i&gt;, Thomas L. Friedman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign affairs columnist for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, offers an engrossing look at the new international system that is transforming world affairs today. Globalization has replaced the Cold War system with the integration of capital, technology, and information across national borders—uniting Brazilian peasants, Indonesian entrepreneurs, Chinese villagers, and Silicon Valley technocrats in a single global village. You cannot understand the morning news, know where to invest your money, or think about the future unless you understand this new system, which is profoundly influencing virtually every country in the world today. Friedman tells you what this electronic global economy is all about and what it will take to live within it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With vivid stories drawn from his extensive travels, he dramatizes the conflict of “the Lexus and the olive tree”—the tension between the globalization system and the ancient forces of culture, geography, tradition, and community. He also details the powerful backlash that globalization produces among those who feel brutalized by it, and he spells out what we all need to do to keep the Lexus and the olive tree in balance. For this new paperback edition, Friedman has substantially expanded and updated his provocative analysis, making it essential reading for all who care about how the world works now.</description>

  <description>&lt;b&gt;THE GREAT GATSBY&lt;/b&gt;, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted “gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,” it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/i&gt; is one of the great classics of twentieth-century literature.</description>

  <description>Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, &lt;i&gt;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&lt;/i&gt; is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet, The Birdcatcher. This translation by Jay Rubin is in collaboration with the author.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter is lucky to reach the age of thirteen, since he has already survived the murderous attacks of the feared Dark Lord on more than one occasion. But his hopes for a quiet term concentrating on Quidditch are dashed when a maniacal mass-murderer escapes from Azkaban, pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guard the prison. It's assumed that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry to be. But is it a coincidence that he can feel eyes watching him in the dark, and should he be taking Professor Trelawney's ghoulish predictions seriously?</description>

  <description>Here is the stunning international bestseller in the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Watership Down&lt;/i&gt; but with a dark, original twist. Unique, daring, and unforgettable, it tells the story of an ordinary family who accidentally threaten the security of a hidden civilization as intelligent as our own--a colony of ants determined to survive at any cost....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Wells and his young family have come to the Paris flat at 3, rue des Sybarites through the bequest of his eccentric late uncle Edmond. Inheriting the dusty apartment, the Wells family are left with only one warning: &lt;i&gt;Never go down into the cellar.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the family dog disappears down the basement steps, Jonathan follows--and soon his wife, his son, and various would-be rescuers vanish into its mysterious depths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in a pine stump in a nearby park, a vast civilization is in turmoil. Here a young female from the russet ant nation of Bel-o-kan learns that a strange new weapon has been killing off her comrades. To find out why, she enlists the help of a warrior ant, and the two set off on separate journeys into a harsh and violent world. It is a world where death takes many forms--savage birds and voracious lizards, warlike dwarf ants and rapacious termites, poisonous beetles and, most bizarre of all, the swift, murderous, giant guardians of the edge of the world: cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the end of the female's desperate quest will be the eerie secret in the cellar at 3, rue des Sybarites--a mystery she must solve in order to fulfill her special destiny as the new queen of her own great empire. But to do so she must first make unthinkable communion with the most barbaric creatures of all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Empire of the Ants&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant evocation of a hidden civilization as complex as our own and far more ancient. It is a fascinating realm where boats are built of leaves and greenflies are domesticated and milked like cows, where citizens lock antennae in "absolute communication" and fight wars with precisely coordinated armies using sprays of glue and acids that can dissolve a snail. Not since &lt;i&gt;Watership Down&lt;/i&gt; has a novel so vividly captured the lives and struggles of a fellow species and the valuable lessons they have to teach us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/i&gt;</description>

  <description>In this brilliant, essential book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Thomas L. Friedman speaks to America's urgent need for national renewal and explains how a green revolution can bring about both a sustainable environment and a sustainable America. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friedman explains how global warming, rapidly growing populations, and the expansion of the world’s middle class through globalization have produced a dangerously unstable planet--one that is "hot, flat, and crowded."  In this &lt;i&gt;Release 2.0 &lt;/i&gt;edition, he also shows how the very habits that led us to ravage the natural world led to the meltdown of the financial markets and the Great Recession.  The challenge of a sustainable way of life presents the United States with an opportunity not only to rebuild its economy, but to lead the world in radically innovating toward cleaner energy.  And it could inspire Americans to something we haven't seen in a long time--nation-building in America--by summoning the intelligence, creativity, and concern for the common good that are our greatest national resources. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hot, Flat, and Crowded&lt;/i&gt; is classic Thomas L. Friedman: fearless, incisive, forward-looking, and rich in surprising common sense about the challenge--and the promise--of the future.</description>

  <description>Do you want to get ahead in life? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Climb the ladder to personal success? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships—so that everyone wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Never Eat Alone&lt;/i&gt;, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps—and inner mindset—he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington’s corridors of power to Hollywood’s A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain’s 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with “networking.” He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t keep score:&lt;/b&gt; It’s never simply about getting what you want. It’s about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Ping” constantly:&lt;/b&gt; The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time—not just when you need something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Never eat alone:&lt;/b&gt; The dynamics of status are the same whether you’re working at a corporation or attending a society event— “invisibility” is a fate worse than failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world’s most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a “conference commando,” and more, &lt;i&gt;Never Eat Alone&lt;/i&gt; is destined to take its place alongside &lt;i&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/i&gt; as an inspirational classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to Earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they were from different planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on years of successful counseling of couples and individuals, &lt;i&gt;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&lt;/i&gt; has helped millions of couples transform their relationships. Now viewed as a modern classic, this phenomenal book has helped men and women realize how different they really are and how to communicate their needs in such a way that conflict doesn't arise and intimacy is given every chance to grow!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes. Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys' house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can't quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys' of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks' time? Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle and magic start to intertwine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.K. Rowling charts Harry Potter's latest adventures in his sixth year at Hogwarts with consummate skill and in breathtaking fashion.</description>

  <description>Before the multi-million, runaway bestseller &lt;i&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;, Dan Brown set his razor-sharp research and storytelling skills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA), an ultra-secret, multibillion-dollar agency many times more powerful than the CIA.&lt;p&gt;When the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage...not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the underground hallways of power to the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the towering cathedrals of Spain, a desperate race unfolds. It is a battle for survival--a crucial bid to destroy a creation of inconceivable genius...an impregnable code-writing formula that threatens to obliterate the post-cold war balance of power. Forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Hailed for its coiled eroticism and the moral claims it makes upon the reader, this mesmerizing novel is a story of love and secrets, horror and compassion, unfolding against the haunted landscape of postwar Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover—then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.</description>

Covey presents a holistic, integrated, principle-centered approach for solving personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and pointed anecdotes, Covey reveals a step-by-step framework for living and working based on fundamental principles or natural laws, giving us the security to adapt to change, and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates. Translated into thirty-four languages and with phenomenal sales, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People has been the key to the success of legions of individuals, business leaders and organizations the world over.</description>
